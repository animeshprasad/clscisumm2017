			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">It is well-known that constituency parsing models designed for English often do not generalize easily to other languages and treebanks.1 Explanations for this phenomenon have included the relative informativeness of lexicalization (Dubey and Keller, 2003; Arun and Keller, 2005), insensitivity to morphology (Cowan and Collins, 2005; Tsarfaty and Sima’an, 2008), and the effect of variable word order (Collins et al., 1999).</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Certainly these linguistic factors increase the difficulty of syntactic disambiguation.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Less frequently studied is the interplay among language, annotation choices, and parsing model design (Levy and Manning, 2003; Ku¨ bler, 2005).</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">1 The apparent difficulty of adapting constituency models to non-configurational languages has been one motivation for dependency representations (Hajicˇ and Zema´nek, 2004; Habash and Roth, 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">To investigate the influence of these factors, we analyze Modern Standard Arabic (henceforth MSA, or simply “Arabic”) because of the unusual opportunity it presents for comparison to English parsing results.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">The Penn Arabic Treebank (ATB) syntactic guidelines (Maamouri et al., 2004) were purposefully borrowed without major modification from English (Marcus et al., 1993).</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Further, Maamouri and Bies (2004) argued that the English guidelines generalize well to other languages.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">But Arabic contains a variety of linguistic phenomena unseen in English.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Crucially, the conventional orthographic form of MSA text is unvocalized, a property that results in a deficient graphical representation.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">For humans, this characteristic can impede the acquisition of literacy.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">How do additional ambiguities caused by devocalization affect statistical learning?</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">How should the absence of vowels and syntactic markers influence annotation choices and grammar development?</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">Motivated by these questions, we significantly raise baselines for three existing parsing models through better grammar engineering.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">Our analysis begins with a description of syntactic ambiguity in unvocalized MSA text (§2).</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">Next we show that the ATB is similar to other tree- banks in gross statistical terms, but that annotation consistency remains low relative to English (§3).</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">We then use linguistic and annotation insights to develop a manually annotated grammar for Arabic (§4).</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">To facilitate comparison with previous work, we exhaustively evaluate this grammar and two other parsing models when gold segmentation is assumed (§5).</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">Finally, we provide a realistic eval uation in which segmentation is performed both in a pipeline and jointly with parsing (§6).</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">We quantify error categories in both evaluation settings.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">To our knowledge, ours is the first analysis of this kind for Arabic parsing.</S>

			<S sid ="27" ssid = "1">Arabic is a morphologically rich language with a root-and-pattern system similar to other Semitic languages.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "2">The basic word order is VSO, but SVO, VOS, and VO configurations are also possible.2 Nouns and verbs are created by selecting a consonantal root (usually triliteral or quadriliteral), which bears the semantic core, and adding affixes and diacritics.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "3">Particles are uninflected.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "4">Word Head Of Complement POS 1 &apos;01 inna “Indeed, truly” VP Noun VBP 2 &apos;01 anna “That” SBAR Noun IN 3 01 in “If” SBAR Verb IN 4 01 an “to” SBAR Verb IN Table 1: Diacritized particles and pseudo-verbs that, after orthographic normalization, have the equivalent surface form 0 an.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "5">The distinctions in the ATB are linguistically justified, but complicate parsing.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "6">Table 8a shows that the best model recovers SBAR at only 71.0% F1.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "7">Diacritics can also be used to specify grammatical relations such as case and gender.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "8">But diacritics are not present in unvocalized text, which is the standard form of, e.g., news media documents.3 VBD she added VP PUNC S VP VBP NP ...</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "9">VBD she added VP PUNC “ SBAR IN NP 0 NN.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "10">Let us consider an example of ambiguity caused by devocalization.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "11">Table 1 shows four words “ 0 Indeed NN Indeed Saddamwhose unvocalized surface forms 0 an are indistinguishable.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "12">Whereas Arabic linguistic theory as Saddam (a) Reference (b) Stanford signs (1) and (2) to the class of pseudo verbs 01 +i J&gt;1� inna and her sisters since they can beinflected, the ATB conventions treat (2) as a com plementizer, which means that it must be the head of SBAR.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "13">Because these two words have identical complements, syntax rules are typically unhelpful for distinguishing between them.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "14">This is especially true in the case of quotations—which are common in the ATB—where (1) will follow a verb like (2) (Figure 1).</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "15">Even with vocalization, there are linguistic categories that are difficult to identify without semantic clues.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "16">Two common cases are the attribu tive adjective and the process nominal _; maSdar, which can have a verbal reading.4 At tributive adjectives are hard because they are or- thographically identical to nominals; they are inflected for gender, number, case, and definiteness.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "17">Moreover, they are used as substantives much 2 Unlike machine translation, constituency parsing is not significantly affected by variable word order.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "18">However, when grammatical relations like subject and object are evaluated, parsing performance drops considerably (Green et al., 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "19">In particular, the decision to represent arguments in verb- initial clauses as VP internal makes VSO and VOS configurations difficult to distinguish.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "20">Topicalization of NP subjects in SVO configurations causes confusion with VO (pro-drop).</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "21">3 Techniques for automatic vocalization have been studied (Zitouni et al., 2006; Habash and Rambow, 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "22">However, the data sparsity induced by vocalization makes it difficult to train statistical models on corpora of the size of the ATB, so vocalizing and then parsing may well not help performance.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "23">4 Traditional Arabic linguistic theory treats both of these types as subcategories of noun � &apos;.i . Figure 1: The Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2002) is unable to recover the verbal reading of the unvocalized surface form 0 an (Table 1).</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "24">more frequently than is done in English.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "25">Process nominals name the action of the transitive or ditransitive verb from which they derive.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "26">The verbal reading arises when the maSdar has an NP argument which, in vocalized text, is marked in the accusative case.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "27">When the maSdar lacks a determiner, the constituent as a whole resem bles the ubiquitous annexation construct � ?f iDafa.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "28">Gabbard and Kulick (2008) show that there is significant attachment ambiguity associated with iDafa, which occurs in 84.3% of the trees in our development set.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "29">Figure 4 shows a constituent headed by a process nominal with an embedded adjective phrase.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "30">All three models evaluated in this paper incorrectly analyze the constituent as iDafa; none of the models attach the attributive adjectives properly.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "31">For parsing, the most challenging form of ambiguity occurs at the discourse level.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "32">A defining characteristic of MSA is the prevalence of discourse markers to connect and subordinate words and phrases (Ryding, 2005).</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "33">Instead of offsetting new topics with punctuation, writers of MSA in sert connectives such as � wa and � fa to link new elements to both preceding clauses and the text as a whole.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "34">As a result, Arabic sentences are usually long relative to English, especially after Length English (WSJ) Arabic (ATB) ≤ 20 41.9% 33.7% ≤ 40 92.4% 73.2% ≤ 63 99.7% 92.6% ≤ 70 99.9% 94.9% Table 2: Frequency distribution for sentence lengths in the WSJ (sections 2–23) and the ATB (p1–3).</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "35">English parsing evaluations usually report results on sentences up to length 40.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "36">Arabic sentences of up to length 63 would need to be.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "37">evaluated to account for the same fraction of the data.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "38">We propose a limit of 70 words for Arabic parsing evaluations.</S>

			<S sid ="66" ssid = "40">Test set OOV rate is computed using the following splits: ATB (Chiang et al., 2006); CTB6 (Huang and Harper, 2009); Negra (Dubey and Keller, 2003); English, sections 221 (train) and section 23 (test).</S>

			<S sid ="69" ssid = "43">The ATB gives several different analyses to these words to indicate different types of coordination.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "44">But it conflates the coordinating and discourse separator functions of wa (&lt;..4.b � �) into one analysis: conjunction(Table 3).</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "45">A better approach would be to distin guish between these cases, possibly by drawing on the vast linguistic work on Arabic connectives (AlBatal, 1990).</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "46">We show that noun-noun vs. discourse-level coordination ambiguity in Arabic is a significant source of parsing errors (Table 8c).</S>

			<S sid ="74" ssid = "2">Linguistic intuitions like those in the previous section inform language-specific annotation choices.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "3">The resulting structural differences between tree- banks can account for relative differences in parsing performance.</S>

			<S sid ="80" ssid = "8">Evalb, the standard parsing metric, is biased toward such corpora (Sampson and Babarczy, 2003).</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "9">Also surprising is the low test set OOV rate given the possibility of morphological variation in Arabic.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "10">In general, several gross corpus statistics favor the ATB, so other factors must contribute to parsing underperformance.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "11">3.2 Inter-annotator Agreement.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "12">Annotation consistency is important in any supervised learning task.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "13">In the initial release of the ATB, inter-annotator agreement was inferior to other LDC treebanks (Maamouri et al., 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "14">To improve agreement during the revision process, a dual-blind evaluation was performed in which 10% of the data was annotated by independent teams.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "15">Maamouri et al.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "16">(2008) reported agreement between the teams (measured with Evalb) at 93.8% F1, the level of the CTB.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "17">But Rehbein and van Genabith (2007) showed that Evalb should not be used as an indication of real difference— or similarity—between treebanks.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "18">Instead, we extend the variation n-gram method of Dickinson (2005) to compare annotation error rates in the WSJ and ATB.</S>

			<S sid ="100" ssid = "28">Following Dickinson (2005), we randomly sampled 100 variation nuclei from each corpus and evaluated each sample for the presence of an annotation error.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "29">The human evaluators were a non-native, fluent Arabic speaker (the first author) for the ATB and a native English speaker for the WSJ.7 Table 5 shows type- and token-level error rates for each corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "30">The 95% confidence intervals for type-level errors are (5580, 9440) for the ATB and (1400, 4610) for the WSJ.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "31">The results clearly indicate increased variation in the ATB relative to the WSJ, but care should be taken in assessing the magnitude of the difference.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "32">On the one hand, the type-level error rate is not calibrated for the number of n-grams in the sample.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "33">At the same time, the n-gram error rate is sensitive to samples with extreme n-gram counts.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "34">For example, one of the ATB samples was the determiner -&quot;&quot; ; dhalik“that.” The sample occurred in 1507 corpus po sitions, and we found that the annotations were consistent.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "35">If we remove this sample from the evaluation, then the ATB type-level error rises to only 37.4% while the n-gram error rate increases to 6.24%.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "36">The number of ATB n-grams also falls below the WSJ sample size as the largest WSJ sample appeared in only 162 corpus positions.</S>

			<S sid ="258" ssid = "51">The ATB annotation distinguishes between verbal and nominal readings of maSdar process nominals.</S>
			<S sid ="259" ssid = "52">Like verbs, maSdar takes arguments and assigns case to its objects, whereas it also demonstrates nominal characteristics by, e.g., taking determiners and heading iDafa (Fassi Fehri, 1993).</S>
			<S sid ="260" ssid = "53">In the ATB, :: b asta’adah is tagged 48 times as a noun and 9 times as verbal noun.</S>
			<S sid ="261" ssid = "54">Consequently, all three parsers prefer the nominal reading.</S>

			<S sid ="265" ssid = "58">However, the learning curves in Figure 3 show that the Berkeley parser does not exceed our manual grammar by as wide a margin as has been shown for other languages (Petrov, 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="266" ssid = "59">Moreover, the Stanford parser achieves the most exact Leaf Ancestor matches and tagging accuracy that is only 0.1% below the Bikel model, which uses pre-tagged input.</S>
			<S sid ="267" ssid = "60">In Figure 4 we show an example of variation between the parsing models.</S>

			<S sid ="269" ssid = "62">The errors shown are from the Berkeley parser output, but they are representative of the other two parsing models.</S>
			<S sid ="270" ssid = "63">6 Joint Segmentation and Parsing.</S>
			<S sid ="271" ssid = "64">Although the segmentation requirements for Arabic are not as extreme as those for Chinese, Arabic is written with certain cliticized prepositions, pronouns, and connectives connected to adjacent words.</S>
			<S sid ="272" ssid = "65">Since these are distinct syntactic units, they are typically segmented.</S>
			<S sid ="273" ssid = "66">The ATB segmentation scheme is one of many alternatives.</S>
			<S sid ="274" ssid = "67">Until now, all evaluations of Arabic parsing—including the experiments in the previous section—have assumed gold segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="275" ssid = "68">But gold segmentation is not available in application settings, so a segmenter and parser are arranged in a pipeline.</S>
			<S sid ="276" ssid = "69">Segmentation errors cascade into the parsing phase, placing an artificial limit on parsing performance.</S>
			<S sid ="277" ssid = "70">Lattice parsing (Chappelier et al., 1999) is an alternative to a pipeline that prevents cascading errors by placing all segmentation options into the parse chart.</S>
			<S sid ="278" ssid = "71">Recently, lattices have been used successfully in the parsing of Hebrew (Tsarfaty, 2006; Cohen and Smith, 2007), a Semitic language with similar properties to Arabic.</S>
			<S sid ="279" ssid = "72">We extend the Stanford parser to accept pre-generated lattices, where each word is represented as a finite state automaton.</S>
			<S sid ="280" ssid = "73">To combat the proliferation of parsing edges, we prune the lattices according to a hand-constructed lexicon of 31 clitics listed in the ATB annotation guidelines (Maamouri et al., 2009a).</S>
			<S sid ="281" ssid = "74">Formally, for a lexicon L and segments I ∈ L, O ∈/ L, each word automaton accepts the language I∗(O + I)I∗.</S>
			<S sid ="282" ssid = "75">Aside from adding a simple rule to correct alif deletion caused by the preposition J, no other language-specific processing is performed.</S>
			<S sid ="283" ssid = "76">Our evaluation includes both weighted and un- weighted lattices.</S>
			<S sid ="284" ssid = "77">We weight edges using a unigram language model estimated with Good- Turing smoothing.</S>
			<S sid ="285" ssid = "78">Despite their simplicity, uni- gram weights have been shown as an effective feature in segmentation models (Dyer, 2009).13 The joint parser/segmenter is compared to a pipeline that uses MADA (v3.0), a state-of-the-art Arabic segmenter, configured to replicate ATB segmentation (Habash and Rambow, 2005).</S>
			<S sid ="286" ssid = "79">MADA uses an ensemble of SVMs to first re-rank the output of a deterministic morphological analyzer.</S>
			<S sid ="287" ssid = "80">For each 13 Of course, this weighting makes the PCFG an improper distribution.</S>
			<S sid ="288" ssid = "81">However, in practice, unknown word models also make the distribution improper.</S>

			<S sid ="298" ssid = "91">Cohen and Smith (2007) chose a metric like SParseval (Roark et al., 2006) that first aligns the trees and then penalizes segmentation errors with an edit-distance metric.</S>
			<S sid ="299" ssid = "92">But we follow the more direct adaptation of Evalb suggested by Tsarfaty (2006), who viewed exact segmentation as the ultimate goal.</S>
			<S sid ="300" ssid = "93">Therefore, we only score guess/gold pairs with identical character yields, a condition that allows us to measure parsing, tagging, and segmentation accuracy by ignoring whitespace.</S>
			<S sid ="301" ssid = "94">Table 9 shows that MADA produces a high quality segmentation, and that the effect of cascading segmentation errors on parsing is only 1.92% F1.</S>
			<S sid ="302" ssid = "95">However, MADA is language-specific and relies on manually constructed dictionaries.</S>
			<S sid ="303" ssid = "96">Conversely, the lattice parser requires no linguistic resources and produces segmentations of comparable quality.</S>
			<S sid ="304" ssid = "97">Nonetheless, parse quality is much lower in the joint model because a lattice is effectively a long sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="305" ssid = "98">A cell in the bottom row of the parse chart is required for each potential whitespace boundary.</S>
			<S sid ="306" ssid = "99">As we have said, parse quality decreases with sentence length.</S>
			<S sid ="307" ssid = "100">Finally, we note that simple weighting gives nearly a 2% F1 improvement, whereas Goldberg and Tsarfaty (2008) found that unweighted lattices were more effective for Hebrew.</S>
