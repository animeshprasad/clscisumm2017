<S sid ="0">Better Arabic Parsing: Baselines, Evaluations, and Analysis</S>
<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">In this paper, we offer broad insight into the underperformance of Arabic constituency parsing by analyzing the interplay of linguistic phenomena, annotation choices, and model design.</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">First, we identify sources of syntactic ambiguity understudied in the existing parsing literature.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">Second, we show that although the Penn Arabic Treebank is similar to other tree- banks in gross statistical terms, annotation consistency remains problematic.</S>
<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">Third, we develop a human interpretable grammar that is competitive with a latent variable PCFG.</S>
<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Fourth, we show how to build better models for three different parsers.</S>
<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">Finally, we show that in application settings, the absence of gold segmentation lowers parsing performance by 2â€“5% F1.</S>
