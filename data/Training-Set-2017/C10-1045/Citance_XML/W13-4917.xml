			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">1 Introduction.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Syntactic parsing consists of automatically assigning to a natural language sentence a representation of its grammatical structure.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Data-driven approaches to this problem, both for constituency-based and dependency-based parsing, have seen a surge of interest in the last two decades.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">These data-driven parsing approaches obtain state-of-the-art results on the de facto standard Wall Street Journal data set (Marcus et al., 1993) of English (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 2003; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; McDonald et al., 2005; McClosky et al., 2006; Petrov et al., 2006; Nivre et al., 2007b; Carreras et al., 2008; Finkel et al., 2008; ∗Contact authors: djame.seddah@parissorbonne.fr, reut.tsarfaty@weizmann.ac.il, skuebler@indiana.edu Huang, 2008; Huang et al., 2010; Zhang and Nivre, 2011; Bohnet and Nivre, 2012; Shindo et al., 2012), and provide a foundation on which many tasks operating on semantic structure (e.g., recognizing textual entailments) or even discourse structure (coreference, summarization) crucially depend.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">While progress on parsing English — the main language of focus for the ACL community — has inspired some advances on other languages, it has not, by itself, yielded high-quality parsing for other languages and domains.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">This holds in particular for morphologically rich languages (MRLs), where important information concerning the predicate-argument structure of sentences is expressed through word formation, rather than constituent-order patterns as is the case in English and other configurational languages.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">MRLs express information concerning the grammatical function of a word and its grammatical relation to other words at the word level, via phenomena such as inflectional affixes, pronominal clitics, and so on (Tsarfaty et al., 2012c).</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">The nonrigid tree structures and morphological ambiguity of input words contribute to the challenges of parsing MRLs.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">In addition, insufficient language resources were shown to also contribute to parsing difficulty (Tsarfaty et al., 2010; Tsarfaty et al., 2012c, and references therein).</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">These challenges have initially been addressed by native-speaking experts using strong in-domain knowledge of the linguistic phenomena and annotation idiosyncrasies to improve the accuracy and efficiency of parsing models.</S>

			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">Qc 2013 Association for Computational Linguistics recently, advances in PCFG-LA parsing (Petrov et al., 2006) and language-agnostic data-driven dependency parsing (McDonald et al., 2005; Nivre et al., 2007b) have made it possible to reach high accuracy with classical feature engineering techniques in addition to, or instead of, language-specific knowledge.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">With these recent advances, the time has come for establishing the state of the art, and assessing strengths and weaknesses of parsers across different MRLs.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">This paper reports on the first shared task on statistical parsing of morphologically rich languages (the SPMRL Shared Task), organized in collaboration with the 4th SPMRL meeting and co-located with the conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">In defining and executing this shared task, we pursue several goals.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">First, we wish to provide standard training and test sets for MRLs in different representation types and parsing scenarios, so that researchers can exploit them for testing existing parsers across different MRLs.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">Second, we wish to standardize the evaluation protocol and metrics on morphologically ambiguous input, an understudied challenge, which is also present in English when parsing speech data or web-based nonstandard texts.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">Finally, we aim to raise the awareness of the community to the challenges of parsing MRLs and to provide a set of strong baseline results for further improvement.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">The task features data from nine, typologically diverse, languages.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">Unlike previous shared tasks on parsing, we include data in both dependency-based and constituency-based formats, and in addition to the full data setup (complete training data), we provide a small setup (a training subset of 5,000 sentences).</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">We provide three parsing scenarios: one in which gold segmentation, POS tags, and morphological features are provided, one in which segmentation, POS tags, and features are automatically predicted by an external resource, and one in which we provide a lattice of multiple possible morphological analyses and allow for joint disambiguation of the morphological analysis and syntactic structure.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">These scenarios allow us to obtain the performance upper bound of the systems in lab settings using gold input, as well as the expected level of performance in realistic parsing scenarios — where the parser follows a morphological analyzer and is a part of a full-fledged NLP pipeline.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">We first survey previous work on parsing MRLs (§2) and provide a detailed description of the present task, parsing scenarios, and evaluation metrics (§3).</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">We then describe the data sets for the nine languages (§4), present the different systems (§5), and empirical results (§6).</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">Then, we compare the systems along different axes (§7) in order to analyze their strengths and weaknesses.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">Finally, we summarize and conclude with challenges to address in future shared tasks (§8).</S>

	<SECTION title="Background. " number = "2">
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "1">2.1 A Brief History of the SPMRL Field Statistical parsing saw initial success upon the availability of the Penn Treebank (PTB, Marcus et al., 1994).</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "2">With that large set of syntactically annotated sentences at their disposal, researchers could apply advanced statistical modeling and machine learning techniques in order to obtain high quality structure prediction.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "3">The first statistical parsing models were generative and based on treebank grammars (Char- niak, 1997; Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003; Collins, 2003; Petrov et al., 2006; McClosky et al., 2006), leading to high phrase-structure accuracy.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "4">Encouraged by the success of phrase-structure parsers for English, treebank grammars for additional languages have been developed, starting with Czech (Hajicˇ et al., 2000) then with treebanks of Chinese (Levy and Manning, 2003), Arabic (Maamouri et al., 2004b), German (Kübler et al., 2006), French (Abeillé et al., 2003), Hebrew (Sima’an et al., 2001), Italian (Corazza et al., 2004), Spanish (Moreno et al., 2000), and more.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "5">It quickly became apparent that applying the phrase-based treebank grammar techniques is sensitive to language and annotation properties, and that these models are not easily portable across languages and schemes.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "6">An exception to that is the approach by Petrov (2009), who trained latent- annotation treebank grammars and reported good accuracy on a range of languages.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "7">The CoNLL shared tasks on dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007a) highlighted the usefulness of an alternative linguistic formalism for the development of competitive parsing models.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "8">Dependency relations are marked between input tokens directly, and allow the annotation of non-projective dependencies that are parseable efficiently.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "9">Dependency syntax was applied to the description of different types of languages (Tesnière, 1959; Mel’cˇuk, 2001), which raised the hope that in these settings, parsing MRLs will further improve.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "10">However, the 2007 shared task organizers (Nivre et al., 2007a) concluded that: &quot;[Performance] classes are more easily definable via language characteristics than via characteristics of the data sets.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "11">The split goes across training set size, original data format [...], sentence length, percentage of unknown words, number of dependency labels, and ratio of (C)POSTAGS and dependency labels.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "12">The class with the highest top scores contains languages with a rather impoverished morphology.&quot;</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "13">The problems with parsing MRLs have thus not been solved by dependency parsing, but rather, the challenge has been magnified.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "14">The first event to focus on the particular challenges of parsing MRLs was a dedicated panel discussion co-located with IWPT 2009.1 Work presented on Hebrew, Arabic, French, and German made it clear that researchers working on non-English parsing face the same overarching challenges: poor lexical coverage (due to high level of inflection), poor syntactic coverage (due to more flexible word ordering), and, more generally, issues of data sparseness (due to the lack of large-scale resources).</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "15">Additionally, new questions emerged as to the evaluation of parsers in such languages – are the word-based metrics used for English well-equipped to capture performance across frameworks, or performance in the face of morphological complexity?</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "16">This event provoked active discussions and led to the establishment of a series of SPMRL events for the discussion of shared challenges and cross-fertilization among researchers working on parsing MRLs.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "17">The body of work on MRLs that was accumulated through the SPMRL workshops2 and hosting ACL venues contains new results for Arabic (Attia et al., 2010; Marton et al., 2013a), Basque (Bengoetxea and Gojenola, 2010), Croatian (Agic et al., 2013), French (Seddah et al., 2010; Candito and Seddah, 2010; Sigogne et al., 2011), German (Rehbein, 2011), Hebrew (Tsarfaty and Sima’an, 2010; Goldberg and 1 http://alpage.inria.fr/iwpt09/panel.en.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "18">html 2 See http://www.spmrl.org/ and related workshops..</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "19">Elhadad, 2010a), Hindi (Ambati et al., 2010), Korean (Chung et al., 2010; Choi and Palmer, 2011) and Spanish (Le Roux et al., 2012), Tamil (Green et al., 2012), amongst others.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "20">The awareness of the modeling challenges gave rise to new lines of work on topics such as joint morpho-syntactic processing (Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008), Relational-Realizational Parsing (Tsarfaty, 2010), EasyFirst Parsing (Goldberg, 2011), PLCFRS parsing (Kallmeyer and Maier, 2013), the use of factored lexica (Green et al., 2013), the use of bilingual data (Fraser et al., 2013), and more developments that are currently under way.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "21">With new models and data, and with lingering interest in parsing nonstandard English data, questions begin to emerge, such as: What is the realistic performance of parsing MRLs using today’s methods?</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "22">How do the different models compare with one another?</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "23">How do different representation types deal with parsing one particular language?</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "24">Does the success of a parsing model on a language correlate with its representation type and learning method?</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "25">How to parse effectively in the face of resource scarcity?</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "26">The first step to answering all of these questions is providing standard sets of comparable size, streamlined parsing scenarios, and evaluation metrics, which are our main goals in this SPMRL shared task.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "27">2.2 Where We Are At: The Need for.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "28">Cross-Framework, Realistic, Evaluation Procedures The present task serves as the first attempt to standardize the data sets, parsing scenarios, and evaluation metrics for MRL parsing, for the purpose of gaining insights into parsers’ performance across languages.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "29">Ours is not the first cross-linguistic task on statistical parsing.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "30">As mentioned earlier, two previous CoNLL shared tasks focused on cross-linguistic dependency parsing and covered thirteen different languages (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007a).</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "31">However, the settings of these tasks, e.g., in terms of data set sizes or parsing scenarios, made it difficult to draw conclusions about strengths and weaknesses of different systems on parsing MRLs.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "32">A key aspect to consider is the relation between input tokens and tree terminals.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "33">In the standard statistical parsing setup, every input token is assumed to be a terminal node in the syntactic parse tree (after deterministic tokenization of punctuation).</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "34">In MRLs, morphological processes may have conjoined several words into a single token.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "35">Such tokens need to be segmented and their analyses need to be disambiguated in order to identify the nodes in the parse tree.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "36">In previous shared tasks on statistical parsing, morphological information was assumed to be known in advance in order to make the setup comparable to that of parsing English.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "37">In realistic scenarios, however, morphological analyses are initially unknown and are potentially highly ambiguous, so external resources are used to predict them.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "38">Incorrect morphological disambiguation sets a strict ceiling on the expected performance of parsers in real-world scenarios.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "39">Results reported for MRLs using gold morphological information are then, at best, optimistic.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "40">One reason for adopting this less-than-realistic evaluation scenario in previous tasks has been the lack of sound metrics for the more realistic scenario.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "41">Standard evaluation metrics assume that the number of terminals in the parse hypothesis equals the number of terminals in the gold tree.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "42">When the predicted morphological segmentation leads to a different number of terminals in the gold and parse trees, standard metrics such as ParsEval (Black et al., 1991) or Attachment Scores (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) fail to produce a score.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "43">In this task, we use TedEval (Tsarfaty et al., 2012b), a metric recently suggested for joint morpho-syntactic evaluation, in which normalized tree-edit distance (Bille, 2005) on morpho- syntactic trees allows us to quantify the success on the joint task in realistic parsing scenarios.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "44">Finally, the previous tasks focused on dependency parsing.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "45">When providing both constituency-based and dependency-based tracks, it is interesting to compare results across these frameworks so as to better understand the differences in performance between parsers of different types.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "46">We are now faced with an additional question: how can we compare parsing results across different frameworks?</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "47">Adopting standard metrics will not suffice as we would be comparing apples and oranges.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "48">In contrast, TedEval is defined for both phrase structures and dependency structures through the use of an intermediate representation called function trees (Tsarfaty et al., 2011; Tsarfaty et al., 2012a).</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "49">Using TedEval thus allows us to explore both dependency and constituency parsing frameworks and meaningfully compare the performance of parsers of different types.</S>

	<SECTION title="Defining the Shared-Task. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "1">3.1 Input and Output.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "2">We define a parser as a structure prediction function that maps sequences of space-delimited input tokens (henceforth, tokens) in a language to a set of parse trees that capture valid morpho-syntactic structures in that language.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "3">In the case of constituency parsing, the output structures are phrase-structure trees.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "4">In dependency parsing, the output consists of dependency trees.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "5">We use the term tree terminals to refer to the leaves of a phrase-structure tree in the former case and to the nodes of a dependency tree in the latter.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "6">We assume that input sentences are represented as sequences of tokens.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "7">In general, there may be a many-to-many relation between input tokens and tree terminals.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "8">Tokens may be identical to the terminals, as is often the case in English.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "9">A token may be mapped to multiple terminals assigned their own POS tags (consider, e.g., the token “isn’t”), as is the case in some MRLs.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "10">Several tokens may be grouped into a single (virtual) node, as is the case with multiword expressions (MWEs) (consider “pomme de terre” for “potatoe”).</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "11">This task covers all these cases.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "12">In the standard setup, all tokens are tree terminals.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "13">Here, the task of a parser is to predict a syntactic analysis in which the tree terminals coincide with the tokens.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "14">Disambiguating the morphological analyses that are required for parsing corresponds to selecting the correct POS tag and possibly a set of morphological features for each terminal.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "15">For the languages Basque, French, German, Hungarian, Korean, Polish, and Swedish, we assume this standard setup.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "16">In the morphologically complex setup, every token may be composed of multiple terminals.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "17">In this case, the task of the parser is to predict the sequence of tree terminals, their POS tags, and a correct tree associated with this sequence of terminals.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "18">Disambiguating the morphological analysis therefore requires splitting the tokens into segments that define the terminals.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "19">For the Semitic languages Arabic and Hebrew, we assume this morphologically complex setup.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "20">In the multiword expression (MWEs) setup, provided here for French only, groupings of terminals are identified as MWEs (non-terminal nodes in constituency trees, marked heads in dependency trees).</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "21">Here, the parser is required to predict how terminals are grouped into MWEs on top of predicting the tree.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "22">3.2 Data Sets.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "23">The task features nine languages from six language families, from Germanic languages (Swedish and German) and Romance (French) to Slavic (Polish), Koreanic (Korean), Semitic (Arabic, Hebrew), Uralic (Hungarian), and the language isolate Basque.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "24">These languages cover a wide range of morphological richness, with Arabic, Basque, and Hebrew exhibiting a high degree of inflectional and derivational morphology.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "25">The Germanic languages, German and Swedish, have greater degrees of phrasal ordering freedom than English.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "26">While French is not standardly classified as an MRL, it shares MRLs characteristics which pose challenges for parsing, such as a richer inflectional system than English.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "27">For each contributing language, we provide two sets of annotated sentences: one annotated with labeled phrase-structure trees, and one annotated with labeled dependency trees.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "28">The sentences in the two representations are aligned at token and POS levels.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "29">Both representations reflect the predicate-argument structure of the same sentence, but this information is expressed using different formal terms and thus results in different tree structures.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "30">Since some of our native data sets are larger than others, we provide the training set in two sizes: Full containing all sentences in the standard training set of the language, and 5k containing the number of sentences that is equivalent in size to our smallest training set (5k sentences).</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "31">For all languages, the data has been split into sentences, and the sentences are parsed and evaluated independently of one another.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "32">3.3 Parsing Scenarios.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "33">In the shared task, we consider three parsing scenarios, depending on how much of the morphological information is provided.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "34">The scenarios are listed below, in increasing order of difficulty.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "35">• Gold: In this scenario, the parser is providedwith unambiguous gold morphological segmen tation, POS tags, and morphological features for each input token.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "36">• Predicted: In this scenario, the parser is provided with disambiguated morphological segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "37">However, the POS tags and morphological features for each input segment are unknown.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "38">Scenario Segmentation PoS+Feat.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "39">Tree Gold Predicted Raw (1-best) Raw (all) ..( ..( 1-best – ..( 1-best 1-best – – – – – Table 1: A summary of the parsing and evaluation scenarios.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "40">..( depicts gold information, – depicts unknown information, to be predicted by the system.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "41">• Raw: In this scenario, the parser is provided with morphologically ambiguous input.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "42">The morphological segmentation, POS tags, and morphological features for each input token are unknown.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "43">The Predicted and Raw scenarios require predicting morphological analyses.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "44">This may be done using a language-specific morphological analyzer, or it may be done jointly with parsing.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "45">We provide inputs that support these different scenarios: • Predicted: Gold treebank segmentation is given to the parser.</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "46">The POS tags assignment and morphological features are automatically predicted by the parser or by an external resource.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "47">• Raw (1-best): The 1st-best segmentation and POS tags assignment is predicted by an external resource and given to the parser.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "48">• Raw (all): All possible segmentations and POS tags are specified by an external resource.</S>
			<S sid ="130" ssid = "49">The parser selects jointly a segmentation and a tree.</S>
			<S sid ="131" ssid = "50">An overview of all shown in table 1.</S>
			<S sid ="132" ssid = "51">For languages in which terminals equal tokens, only Gold and Predicted scenarios are considered.</S>
			<S sid ="133" ssid = "52">For Semitic languages we further provide input for both Raw (1- best) and Raw (all) scenarios.</S>
			<S sid ="134" ssid = "53">3 3.4 Evaluation Metrics.</S>
			<S sid ="135" ssid = "54">This task features nine languages, two different representation types and three different evaluation scenarios.</S>
			<S sid ="136" ssid = "55">In order to evaluate the quality of the predicted structures in the different tracks, we use a combination of evaluation metrics that allow us to compare the systems along different axes.</S>
			<S sid ="137" ssid = "56">3 The raw Arabic lattices were made available later than the other data.</S>
			<S sid ="138" ssid = "57">They are now included in the shared task release.</S>
			<S sid ="139" ssid = "58">In this section, we formally define the different evaluation metrics and discuss how they support system comparison.</S>
			<S sid ="140" ssid = "59">Throughout this paper, we will be referring to different evaluation dimensions: • Cross-Parser Evaluation in Gold/Predicted Scenarios.</S>
			<S sid ="141" ssid = "60">Here, we evaluate the results of different parsers on a single data set in the Gold or Predicted setting.</S>
			<S sid ="142" ssid = "61">We use standard evalu ation metrics for the different types of analyses, that is, ParsEval (Black et al., 1991) on phrase-structure trees, and Labeled Attachment Scores (LAS) (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) for dependency trees.</S>
			<S sid ="143" ssid = "62">Since ParsEval is known to be sensitive to the size and depth of trees (Rehbein and van Genabith, 2007b), we also provide the Leaf-Ancestor metric (Sampson and Babarczy, 2003), which is less sensitive to the depth of the phrase-structure hierarchy.</S>
			<S sid ="144" ssid = "63">In both scenarios we also provide metrics to evaluate the prediction of MultiWord Expressions.</S>
			<S sid ="145" ssid = "64">• Cross-Parser Evaluation in Raw Scenarios.</S>
			<S sid ="146" ssid = "65">Here, we evaluate the results of different parsers on a single data set in scenarios where morphological segmentation is not known in advance.</S>
			<S sid ="147" ssid = "66">When a hypothesized segmentation is not identical to the gold segmentation, standard evaluation metrics such as ParsEval and Attachment Scores break down.</S>
			<S sid ="148" ssid = "67">Therefore, we use TedEval (Tsarfaty et al., 2012b), which jointly assesses the quality of the morphological and syntactic analysis in morphologically-complex scenarios.</S>
			<S sid ="149" ssid = "68">• Cross-Framework Evaluation.</S>
			<S sid ="150" ssid = "69">Here, we compare the results obtained by a dependency parser and a constituency parser on the same set of sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="151" ssid = "70">In order to avoid comparing apples and oranges, we use the unlabeled TedEval metric, which converts all representation types internally into the same kind of structures, called function trees.</S>
			<S sid ="152" ssid = "71">Here we use TedEval’s cross- framework protocol (Tsarfaty et al., 2012a), which accomodates annotation idiosyncrasies.</S>
			<S sid ="153" ssid = "72">• Cross-Language Evaluation.</S>
			<S sid ="154" ssid = "73">Here, we compare parsers for the same representation type across different languages.</S>
			<S sid ="155" ssid = "74">Conducting a complete and faithful evaluation across languages would require a harmonized universal annotation scheme (possibly along the lines of (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008; McDonald et al., 2013; Tsarfaty, 2013)) or task based evaluation.</S>

			<S sid ="162" ssid = "81">3.4.1 Evaluation Metrics for Phrase Structures ParsEval The ParsEval metrics (Black et al., 1991) are evaluation metrics for phrase-structure trees.</S>
			<S sid ="163" ssid = "82">Despite various shortcomings, they are the defacto stan dard for system comparison on phrase-structure parsing, used in many campaigns and shared tasks (e.g., (Kübler, 2008; Petrov and McDonald, 2012)).</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "83">Assume that G and H are phrase-structure gold and hypothesized trees respectively, each of which is represented by a set of tuples (i, A, j) where A is a labeled constituent spanning from i to j. Assume that g is the same as G except that it discards the root, preterminal, and terminal nodes, likewise for h and H . The ParsEval scores define the accuracy of the hypothesis in terms of the normalized size of the intersection of the constituent sets.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "84">P recision(g, h) = |g∩h| |h| Recall(g, h) = |g∩h| |g| F1(g, h) = 2×P ×R We evaluate accuracy on phrase-labels ignoring any further decoration, as it is in standard practices.</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "85">Evalb, the standard software that implements Par- sEval,4 takes a parameter file and ignores the labels specified therein.</S>
			<S sid ="167" ssid = "86">As usual, we ignore root and POS labels.</S>
			<S sid ="168" ssid = "87">Contrary to the standard practice, we do take punctuation into account.</S>
			<S sid ="169" ssid = "88">Note that, as opposed to the official version, we used the SANCL’2012 version5 modified to actually penalize non-parsed trees.</S>
			<S sid ="170" ssid = "89">4 http://www.spmrl.org/ spmrl2013sharedtask-metrics.html/#Evalb 5 Modified by Petrov and McDonald (2012) to be less sensitive to punctuation errors.</S>
			<S sid ="171" ssid = "90">Leaf-Ancestor The Leaf-Ancestor metric (Sampson and Babarczy, 2003) measures the similarity between the path from each terminal node to the root node in the output tree and the corresponding path in the gold tree.</S>
			<S sid ="172" ssid = "91">The path consists of a sequence of node labels between the terminal node and the root node, and the similarity of two paths is calculated by using the Levenshtein distance.</S>
			<S sid ="173" ssid = "92">This distance is normalized by path length, and the score of the tree is an aggregated score of the values for all terminals in the tree (xt is the leaf-ancestor path of t in tree x).</S>

			<S sid ="176" ssid = "95">(2012a) and Tsarfaty et al.</S>
			<S sid ="177" ssid = "96">(2012b) for coping with nontrivial evaluation scenarios, e.g., comparing parsing results across different frameworks, across representation theories, and across different morphological segmentation hypotheses.8 Contrary to the previous metrics, which view accuracy as a normalized intersection over sets, TedEval computes the ac LA(h, g) = t∈yield(g) Lv(ht ,gt )/(len(ht )+len(gt )) |yield(g)| curacy of a parse tree based on the tree-edit distance between complete trees.</S>
			<S sid ="178" ssid = "97">Assume a finite set of (pos sibly parameterized) edit operations A = {a1....an},This metric was shown to be less sensitive to dif ferences between annotation schemes in (Kübler et al., 2008), and was shown by Rehbein and van Genabith (2007a) to evaluate trees more faithfully than ParsEval in the face of certain annotation decisions.</S>
			<S sid ="179" ssid = "98">We used the implementation of Wagner (2012).6 3.4.2 Evaluation Metrics for Dependency StructuresAttachment Scores Labeled and Unlabeled At and a cost function c : A → 1.</S>
			<S sid ="180" ssid = "99">An edit script is thecost of a sequence of edit operations, and the edit dis tance of g, h is the minimal cost edit script that turns g into h (and vice versa).</S>
			<S sid ="181" ssid = "100">The normalized distance subtracted from 1 provides the level of accuracy on the task.</S>
			<S sid ="182" ssid = "101">Formally, the TedEval score on g, h is defined as follows, where ted is the tree-edit distance, and the |x| (size in nodes) discards terminals and root nodes.</S>
			<S sid ="183" ssid = "102">tachment scores have been proposed as evaluation ted T edEval(g, h) = 1 − (g, h) metrics for dependency parsing in the CoNLL shared tasks (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007a) and have since assumed the role of standard metrics in multiple shared tasks and independent studies.</S>
			<S sid ="184" ssid = "103">Assume that g, h are gold and hypothesized dependency trees respectively, each of which is represented by a set of arcs (i, A, j) where A is a labeled arc from terminal i to terminal j. Recall that in the gold and predicted settings, |g| = |h| (because the number of terminals determines the number of arcs and hence it is fixed).</S>
			<S sid ="185" ssid = "104">So Labeled Attachment Score equals precision and recall, and it is calculated as a normalized size of the intersection between the sets of gold and parsed arcs.7 P recision(g, h) = |g∩h| |g| Recall(g, h) = |g∩h| |h| LAS(g, h) = |g∩h| = |g∩h| |g| + |h| In the gold scenario, we are not allowed to manipulate terminal nodes, only non-terminals.</S>

			<S sid ="204" ssid = "4">Dependency structures are provided in the CoNLL-X format.10 For any given language, the dependency and constituency treebanks are aligned at the token and terminal levels and share the same POS tagset and morphological features.</S>

			<S sid ="215" ssid = "15">Arabic is a morphologically complex language which has rich inflectional and derivational morphology.</S>
			<S sid ="216" ssid = "16">It exhibits a high degree of morphological ambiguity due to the absence of the diacritics and inconsistent spelling of letters, such as Alif and Ya.</S>

			<S sid ="219" ssid = "19">We preprocessed the treebanks to obtain strict token matching between the treebanks and the morphological analyses.</S>

			<S sid ="267" ssid = "67">A major difference between the CATiB treebank and the Stanford treebank lies in the way they handle paragraph annotations.</S>

			<S sid ="269" ssid = "69">While the CATiB conversion tool considers each sequence a single parsing unit, the Stanford pre-processor treats each such tree structure rooted at S, NP or Frag as a tree spanning a single sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="270" ssid = "70">To be compatible with the predicted morphology data which was bootstrapped and trained on the CATiB interpretation, we deterministically modified the original PATB by adding pseudo XP root nodes, so that the Stanford preproprecessor will generate the same tree yields as the CATiB treebank.</S>

			<S sid ="430" ssid = "230">Sentences were manually assigned a constituency-based syntactic structure, which includes information on phrase structure, grammatical functions (such as subject, object, etc.), and subcategorization information (i.e., a given NP is subcategorized by a verb or an infinitive).</S>
			<S sid ="431" ssid = "231">The constituency trees were later automatically converted into dependency structures, and all sentences were then manually corrected.</S>
			<S sid ="432" ssid = "232">Note that there exist some differences in the grammatical functions applied to the constituency and dependency versions of the tree- bank, since some morpho-syntactic information was coded both as a morphological feature and as decoration on top of the grammatical function in the constituency trees.</S>
			<S sid ="433" ssid = "233">Adapting the Data to the Shared Task Originally, the Szeged Dependency Treebank contained virtual nodes for elided material (ELL) and phonologically covert copulas (VAN).</S>
			<S sid ="434" ssid = "234">In the current version, they have been deleted, their daughters have been attached to the parent of the virtual node, and have been given complex labels, e.g. COORD-VAN-SUBJ, where VAN is the type of the virtual node deleted, COORD is the label of the virtual node and SUBJ is the label of the daughter itself.</S>
			<S sid ="435" ssid = "235">When the virtual node was originally the root of the sentence, its daughter with a predicative (PRED) label has been selected as the new root of the sentence (with the label ROOT- VAN-PRED) and all the other daughters of the deleted virtual node have been attached to it.</S>
			<S sid ="436" ssid = "236">Predicted Morphology In order to provide the same POS tag set for the constituent and dependency treebanks, we used the dependency POS tagset for both treebank instances.</S>
			<S sid ="437" ssid = "237">Both versions of the tree- bank are available with gold standard and automatic morphological annotation.</S>
			<S sid ="438" ssid = "238">The automatic POS tagging was carried out by a 10-fold cross-validation on the shared task data set by magyarlanc, a natural language toolkit for processing Hungarian texts (segmentation, morphological analysis, POS tagging, and dependency parsing).</S>
			<S sid ="439" ssid = "239">The annotation provides POS tags and deep morphological features for each input token (Zsibrita et al., 2013).28 28 The full data sets of both the constituency and dependency versions of the Szeged Treebank are available at 4.8 The Korean Treebank.</S>
			<S sid ="440" ssid = "240">The Treebank The Korean corpus is generated by collecting constituent trees from the KAIST Tree- bank (Choi et al., 1994), then converting the constituent trees to dependency trees using head-finding rules and heuristics.</S>
			<S sid ="441" ssid = "241">The KAIST Treebank consists of about 31K manually annotated constituent trees from 97 different sources (e.g., newspapers, novels, textbooks).</S>
			<S sid ="442" ssid = "242">After filtering out trees containing annotation errors, a total of 27,363 trees with 350,090 tokens are collected.</S>
			<S sid ="443" ssid = "243">The constituent trees in the KAIST Treebank29 also come with manually inspected morphological analysis based on ‘eojeol’.</S>
			<S sid ="444" ssid = "244">An eojeol contains root-forms of word tokens agglutinated with grammatical affixes (e.g., case particles, ending markers).</S>
			<S sid ="445" ssid = "245">An eojeol can consist of more than one word token; for instance, a compound noun “bus stop” is often represented as one eojeol in Korean, ll1-&quot;-A&apos;02rrA&apos;0, which can be broken into two word tokens, ll1-&quot;- (bus) and A&apos;02rrA&apos;0 (stop).</S>
			<S sid ="446" ssid = "246">Each eojeol in the KAIST Treebank is separated by white spaces regardless of punctuation.</S>
			<S sid ="447" ssid = "247">Following the Penn Korean Treebank guidelines (Han et al., 2002), punctuation is separated as individual tokens, and parenthetical notations surrounded by round brackets are grouped into individual phrases with a function tag (PRN in our corpus).</S>
			<S sid ="448" ssid = "248">All dependency trees are automatically converted from the constituent trees.</S>
			<S sid ="449" ssid = "249">Unlike English, which requires complicated head-finding rules to find the head of each phrase (Choi and Palmer, 2012), Korean is a head final language such that the rightmost constituent in each phrase becomes the head of that phrase.</S>
			<S sid ="450" ssid = "250">Moreover, the rightmost conjunct becomes the head of all other conjuncts and conjunctions in a coordination phrase, which aligns well with our head-final strategy.</S>
			<S sid ="451" ssid = "251">The constituent trees in the KAIST Treebank do not consist of function tags indicating syntactic or semantic roles, which makes it difficult to generate dependency labels.</S>
			<S sid ="452" ssid = "252">However, it is possible to generate meaningful labels by using the rich morphology in Korean.</S>
			<S sid ="453" ssid = "253">For instance, case particles give good the following website: www.inf.u-szeged.hu/rgai/ SzegedTreebank, and magyarlanc is downloadable from: www.inf.u-szeged.hu/rgai/magyarlanc.</S>

			<S sid ="471" ssid = "271">The Data Set The Swedish data sets are taken from the Talbanken section of the Swedish Treebank (Nivre and Megyesi, 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="472" ssid = "272">Talbanken is a syntactically annotated corpus developed in the 1970s, originally annotated according to the MAMBA scheme (Teleman, 1974) with a syntactic layer consisting of flat phrase structure and grammatical functions.</S>

			<S sid ="475" ssid = "275">The analyzed texts come from the one-million-token sub- corpus of the National Corpus of Polish (NKJP, (Przepiórkowski et al., 2012)) manually annotated with morpho-syntactic tags.</S>
			<S sid ="476" ssid = "276">The dependency version of Składnica is a result of an automatic conversion of manually disambiguated constituent trees into dependency structures (Wróblewska, 2012).</S>
			<S sid ="477" ssid = "277">The conversion was an entirely automatic process.</S>
			<S sid ="478" ssid = "278">Conversion rules were based on morpho-syntactic information, phrasal categories, and types of phrase-structure rules encoded within constituent trees.</S>
			<S sid ="479" ssid = "279">It was possible to extract dependencies because the constituent trees contain information about the head of the majority of constituents.</S>
			<S sid ="480" ssid = "280">For other constituents, heuristics were defined in order to select their heads.</S>

			<S sid ="482" ssid = "282">(2006).</S>
			<S sid ="483" ssid = "283">Both the phrase structure and the dependency version use the functional labels from the original MAMBA scheme, which provides a fine-grained classification of syntactic functions with 65 different labels, while the phrase structure annotation (which had to be inferred automatically) uses a coarse set of only 8 labels.</S>
			<S sid ="484" ssid = "284">For the release of the Swedish tree- bank, the POS level was re-annotated to conform to the current de facto standard for Swedish, which is the StockholmUmeå tagset (Ejerhed et al., 1992) with 25 base tags and 25 morpho-syntactic features, which together produce over 150 complex tags.</S>
			<S sid ="485" ssid = "285">For the shared task, we used version 1.2 of the treebank, where a number of conversion errors in the dependency version have been corrected.</S>

			<S sid ="491" ssid = "1">With 7 teams participating, more than 14 systems for French and 10 for Arabic and German, this shared task is on par with the latest large-scale parsing evaluation campaign SANCL 2012 (Petrov and McDonald, 2012).</S>
			<S sid ="492" ssid = "2">The present shared task was extremely demanding on our participants.</S>
			<S sid ="493" ssid = "3">From 30 individuals or teams who registered and obtained the data sets, we present results for the seven teams that accomplished successful executions on these data in the relevant scenarios in the given the time frame.</S>
			<S sid ="494" ssid = "4">5.1 Dependency Track.</S>
			<S sid ="495" ssid = "5">Seven teams participated in the dependency track.</S>
			<S sid ="496" ssid = "6">Two participating systems are based on MaltParser: MALTOPTIMIZER (Ballesteros, 2013) and AI:KU (Cirik and S¸ ensoy, 2013).</S>
			<S sid ="497" ssid = "7">MALTOPTIMIZER uses a variant of MaltOptimizer (Ballesteros and Nivre, 2012) to explore features relevant for the processing of morphological information.</S>
			<S sid ="498" ssid = "8">AI:KU uses a combination of MaltParser and the original MaltOptimizer.</S>
			<S sid ="499" ssid = "9">Their system development has focused on the integration of an unsupervised word clustering method using contextual and morphological properties of the words, to help combat sparseness.</S>
			<S sid ="500" ssid = "10">Similarly to MaltParser ALPAGE:DYALOG (De La Clergerie, 2013) also uses a shift-reduce transition-based parser but its training and decoding algorithms are based on beam search.</S>
			<S sid ="501" ssid = "11">This parser is implemented on top of the tabular logic programming system DyALog.</S>
			<S sid ="502" ssid = "12">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dependency parser capable of handling word lattice input.</S>
			<S sid ="503" ssid = "13">Three participating teams use the MATE parser (Bohnet, 2010) in their systems: the BASQUETEAM (Goenaga et al., 2013), IGM:ALPAGE (Constant et al., 2013) and IMS:SZEGED:CIS (Björkelund et al., 2013).</S>
			<S sid ="504" ssid = "14">The BASQUETEAM uses the MATE parser in combination with MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007b).</S>
			<S sid ="505" ssid = "15">The system combines the parser outputs via Malt- Blender (Hall et al., 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="506" ssid = "16">IGM:ALPAGE also uses MATE and MaltParser, once in a pipeline architecture and once in a joint model.</S>
			<S sid ="507" ssid = "17">The models are combined via a re-parsing strategy based on (Sagae and Lavie, 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="508" ssid = "18">This system mainly focuses on MWEs in French and uses a CRF tagger in combination with several large-scale dictionaries to handle MWEs, which then serve as input for the two parsers.</S>
			<S sid ="509" ssid = "19">The IMS:SZEGED:CIS team participated in both tracks, with an ensemble system.</S>
			<S sid ="510" ssid = "20">For the dependency track, the ensemble includes the MATE parser (Bohnet, 2010), a best-first variant of the easy-first parser by Goldberg and Elhadad (2010b), and turbo parser (Martins et al., 2010), in combination with a ranker that has the particularity of using features from the constituent parsed trees.</S>
			<S sid ="511" ssid = "21">CADIM (Marton et al., 2013b) uses their variant of the easy-first parser combined with a feature-rich ensemble of lexical and syntactic resources.</S>
			<S sid ="512" ssid = "22">Four of the participating teams use external resources in addition to the parser.</S>
			<S sid ="513" ssid = "23">The IMS:SZEGED:CIS team uses external morphological analyzers.</S>
			<S sid ="514" ssid = "24">CADIM uses SAMA (Graff et al., 2009) for Arabic morphology.</S>
			<S sid ="515" ssid = "25">ALPAGE:DYALOG and IGM:ALPAGE use external lexicons for French.</S>
			<S sid ="516" ssid = "26">IGM:ALPAGE additionally uses Morfette (Chrupała et al., 2008) for morphological analysis and POS tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="517" ssid = "27">Finally, as already mentioned, AI:KU clusters words and POS tags in an unsupervised fashion exploiting additional, un-annotated data.</S>
			<S sid ="518" ssid = "28">5.2 Constituency Track.</S>
			<S sid ="519" ssid = "29">A single team participated in the constituency parsing task, the IMS:SZEGED:CIS team (Björkelund et al., 2013).</S>
			<S sid ="520" ssid = "30">Their phrase-structure parsing system uses a combination of 8 PCFG-LA parsers, trained using a product-of-grammars procedure (Petrov, 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="521" ssid = "31">The 50-best parses of this combination are then reranked by a model based on the reranker by Charniak and Johnson (2005).33 5.3 Baselines.</S>
			<S sid ="522" ssid = "32">We additionally provide the results of two baseline systems for the nine languages, one for constituency parsing and one for dependency parsing.</S>
			<S sid ="523" ssid = "33">For the dependency track, our baseline system is MaltParser in its default configuration (the arc-eager algorithm and liblinear for training).</S>
			<S sid ="524" ssid = "34">Results marked as BASE:MALT in the next two sections report the results of this baseline system in different scenarios.</S>
			<S sid ="525" ssid = "35">The constituency parsing baseline is based on the most recent version of the PCFG-LA model of Petrov et al.</S>
			<S sid ="526" ssid = "36">(2006), used with its default settings and five split/merge cycles, for all languages.34 We use this parser in two configurations: a ‘1-best’ configuration where all POS tags are provided to the parser (predicted or gold, depending on the scenario), and another configuration in which the parser performs its own POS tagging.</S>
			<S sid ="527" ssid = "37">These baselines are referred to as BASE:BKY+POS and BASE:BKY+RAW respectively in the following results sections.</S>
			<S sid ="528" ssid = "38">Note that even when BASE:BKY+POS is given gold POS tags, the Berkeley parser sometimes fails to reach a perfect POS accuracy.</S>
			<S sid ="529" ssid = "39">In cases when the parser cannot find a parse with the provided POS, it falls back on its own POS tagging for all tokens.</S>

			<S sid ="569" ssid = "40">Treebank variance depends not only on the language but also on annotation decisions, such as label set (Swedish, interestingly, has a relatively rich one).</S>
			<S sid ="570" ssid = "41">A more careful comparison would then take into account the correlation of data size, label set size and parsing accuracy.</S>
			<S sid ="571" ssid = "42">We investigate these correlations further in section 7.1.</S>
			<S sid ="572" ssid = "43">6.1.2 Multiword Expressions MWE results on the gold setting are found at the top of Table 4.</S>
			<S sid ="573" ssid = "44">All systems, with the exception of BASE:MALT, perform exceedingly well in identifying the spans and non-head components of MWEs given gold morphology.36 These almost perfect scores are the consequence of the presence of two gold MWE features, namely MWEHEAD and PRED=Y, which respectively indicate the node span of the whole MWE and its dependents, which do not have a gold feature field.</S>
			<S sid ="574" ssid = "45">The interesting scenario is, of course, the predicted one, where these features are not provided to the parser, as in any realistic application.</S>
			<S sid ="575" ssid = "46">36 Note that for the labeled measure F_MWE+POS, both MALTOPTIMIZER and ALPAGE:DYALOG have an F-score of zero, since they do not attempt to predict the MWE label at all.</S>
			<S sid ="576" ssid = "47">6.1.3 Constituency Parsing In this part, we provide accuracy results for phrase- structure trees in terms of ParsEval F-scores.</S>
			<S sid ="577" ssid = "48">Since ParsEval is sensitive to the non-terminals-per-word ratio in the data set (Rehbein and van Genabith, 2007a; Rehbein and van Genabith, 2007b), and given the fact that this ratio varies greatly within our data set (as shown in Table 2), it must be kept in mind that ParsEval should only be used for comparing parsing performance over treebank instances sharing the exact same properties in term of annotation schemes, sentence length and so on.</S>
			<S sid ="578" ssid = "49">When comparing F-Scores across different treebanks and languages, it can only provide a rough estimate of the relative difficulty or ease of parsing these kinds of data.</S>
			<S sid ="579" ssid = "50">Full Training Set The F-score results for the gold scenario are provided in the first block of Table 5.</S>
			<S sid ="580" ssid = "51">Among the two baselines, BASE:BKY+POS fares better than BASE:BKY+RAW since the latter selects its own POS tags and thus cannot benefit from the gold information.</S>
			<S sid ="581" ssid = "52">The IMS:SZEGED:CIS system clearly outperforms both baselines, with Hebrew as an outlier.37 As in the dependency case, the results are not strictly comparable across languages, yet we can draw some insights from them.</S>
			<S sid ="582" ssid = "53">We see considerable differences between the languages, with Basque, Hebrew, and Hungarian reaching F-scores in the low 90s for the IMS:SZEGED:CIS system, Korean and Polish reaching above-average F-scores, and Arabic, French, German, and Swedish reaching F-scores below the average, but still in the low 80s.</S>
			<S sid ="583" ssid = "54">The performance is, again, not correlated with data set sizes.</S>
			<S sid ="584" ssid = "55">Parsing Hebrew, with one of the smallest training sets, obtains higher accuracy many other languages, including Swedish, which has the same training set size as Hebrew.</S>
			<S sid ="585" ssid = "56">It may well be that gold morphological information is more useful for combatting sparseness in languages with richer morphology (though Arabic here would be an outlier for this conjecture), or it may be that certain treebanks and schemes are inherently harder to parser than others, as we investigate in section 7.</S>
			<S sid ="586" ssid = "57">For German, the language with the largest training 37 It might be that the easy layer of syntactic tags benefits from the gold POS tags provided.</S>

			<S sid ="600" ssid = "71">6.1.4 Leaf-Ancestor Results The variation across results in the previous subsection may have been due to differences across annotation schemes.</S>
			<S sid ="601" ssid = "72">One way to neutralize this difference (to some extent) is to use a different metric.</S>
			<S sid ="602" ssid = "73">We evaluated the constituency parsing results using the Leaf-Ancestor (LA) metric, which is less sensitive to the number of nodes in a tree (Rehbein and van Genabith, 2007b; Kübler et al., 2008).</S>

			<S sid ="706" ssid = "11">The Korean treebank (pink) in the gold setting and full training set can be parsed with a high LAS relative to its size and label set.</S>
			<S sid ="707" ssid = "12">It is also clear that the Hebrew treebank (purple) in the predicted version is the most difficult one to parse, relative to our expectation about its complexity.</S>
			<S sid ="708" ssid = "13">Since the Hebrew gold scenario is a lot closer to the diagonal again, it may be that this outlier is due to the coverage and quality of the predicted morphology.Figure 340 shows the correlation of data complex ity in terms of the average number of non-terminals per sentence, and parsing accuracy (ParsEval F- score).</S>
			<S sid ="709" ssid = "14">Parsing accuracy is again averaged over all participating systems for a given language.</S>
			<S sid ="710" ssid = "15">In this figure, we see a diagonal similar to the one in figure 2, where Arabic (dark blue) has high complexity of the data (here interpreted as flat trees, low number of non terminals per sentence) and low F-scores accordingly.</S>
			<S sid ="711" ssid = "16">Korean (pink), Swedish (burgundy), Polish (light green), and Hungarian (light blue) follow, and then Hebrew (purple) is a positive outlier, possibly due to an additional layer of “easy&quot; syntactic POS nodes which increases tree size and inflates F-scores.</S>
			<S sid ="712" ssid = "17">French (orange), Basque (red), and German (dark green) are negative outliers, falling off the diagonal.</S>

			<S sid ="714" ssid = "19">what would be expected for the non-terminals per sentence ratio, which is in contrast to the LAS figure where German occurs among the less complex data set to parse.</S>
			<S sid ="715" ssid = "20">A possible explanation may be the crossing branches in the original treebank which were re-attached.</S>
			<S sid ="716" ssid = "21">This creates flat and variable edges which might be hard predict accurately.</S>
			<S sid ="717" ssid = "22">Figure 441 presents the correlation between parsing accuracy in terms the LeafAncestor metrics (macro averaged) and treebank complexity in terms of the average number of non-terminals per sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="718" ssid = "23">As in the correlation figures, the parsing accuracy is averaged over the participanting systems for any language.</S>
			<S sid ="719" ssid = "24">The LeafAncestor accuracy is calculated over phrase structure trees, and we see a similar diagonal to the one in Figure 3 showing that flatter tree- banks are harder (that is, are correlated with lower averaged scores) But, its slope is less steep than for the F-score, which confirms the observation that the LeafAncestor metric is less sensitive than F-score to the non-terminals-per-sentence ratio.</S>
			<S sid ="720" ssid = "25">Similarly to Figure 3, German is a negative outlier, which means that this treebank is harder to parse – it obtains lower scores on average than we would expect.</S>
			<S sid ="721" ssid = "26">As for Hebrew, it is much closer to the diagonal.</S>
			<S sid ="722" ssid = "27">As it turns out, the &quot;easy&quot; POS layer that inflates the scores does not affect the LA ratings as much.</S>

			<S sid ="746" ssid = "51">The unlabeled TedEval results for the raw settings are substantially lower then TedEval results on the gold settings for both languages.</S>
			<S sid ="747" ssid = "52">When comparing the unlabeled TedEval results for Arabic and Hebrew on the participating systems, we see a loss of 34 points between Table 9 (raw) and Table 10 (gold).</S>
			<S sid ="748" ssid = "53">In particular we see that for the best per forming systems on Arabic (IMS:SZEGED:CIS for both constituency and dependency), the gap between gold and realistic scenarios is 3.4 and 4.3 points, for the constituency and the dependency parser respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="749" ssid = "54">These results are on a par with results by Tsarfaty et al.</S>
			<S sid ="750" ssid = "55">(2012b), who showed for different settings, constituency and dependency based, that raw scenarios are considerably more difficult to parse than gold ones on the standard split of the Modern Hebrew treebank.</S>
			<S sid ="751" ssid = "56">For Hebrew, the performance gap between unlabeled TedEval in raw (Table 9) and gold (Table 10) is even more salient, with around 7 and 8 points of difference between the scenarios.</S>
			<S sid ="752" ssid = "57">We can only speculate that such a difference may be due to the difficulty of resolving Hebrew morpho-syntactic ambiguities without sufficient syntactic information.</S>
			<S sid ="753" ssid = "58">Since Hebrew and Arabic now have standardized morphologically and syntactically analyzed data sets available through this task, it will be possible to investigate further how cross-linguistic differences in morphological ambiguity affect full-parsing accuracy in raw scenarios.</S>
			<S sid ="754" ssid = "59">This section compared the raw and gold parsing results only on unlabeled TedEval metrics.</S>
			<S sid ="755" ssid = "60">According to what we have seen so far is expected that for labeled TedEval metrics using the same protocol, the gap between gold and raw scenario will be even greater.</S>
			<S sid ="756" ssid = "61">7.2.2 Cross-Framework Evaluation: Dependency vs. Constituency In this section, our focus is on comparing parsing results across constituency and dependency parsers based on the protocol of Tsarfaty et al.</S>
			<S sid ="757" ssid = "62">(2012a) We have only one submission from IMS:SZEGED:CIS in the constituency track, and.</S>
			<S sid ="758" ssid = "63">from the same group, a submission on the dependency track.</S>
			<S sid ="759" ssid = "64">We only compare the IMS:SZEGED:CIS results on constituency and dependency parsing with the two baselines we provided.</S>
			<S sid ="760" ssid = "65">The results of the cross-framework evaluation protocol are shown in Table 11.</S>
			<S sid ="761" ssid = "66">The results comparing the two variants of the IMS:SZEGED:CIS systems show that they are very close for all languages, with differences ranging from 0.03 for German to 0.8 for Polish in the gold setting.</S>
			<S sid ="762" ssid = "67">It has often been argued that dependency parsers perform better than a constituency parser, but we notice that when using a cross framework protocol, such as TedEval, and assuming that our test set sample is representative, the difference between the interpretation of both representation’s performance is alleviated.</S>
			<S sid ="763" ssid = "68">Of course, here the metric is unlabeled, so it simply tells us that both kind of parsing models are equally able to provide similar tree structures.</S>
			<S sid ="764" ssid = "69">Said differently, the gaps in the quality of predicting the same underlying structure across representations for MRLs is not as large as is sometimes assumed.</S>
			<S sid ="765" ssid = "70">For most languages, the baseline constituency parser performs better than the dependency baseline one, with Basque and Korean as an exception, and at the same time, the dependency version of IMS:SZEGED:CIS performs slightly better than their constituent parser for most languages, with the exception of Hebrew and Hungarian.</S>
			<S sid ="766" ssid = "71">It goes to show that, as far as these present MRL results go, there is no clear preference for a dependency over a constituency parsing representation, just preferences among particular models.</S>
			<S sid ="767" ssid = "72">More generally, we can say that even if the linguistic coverage of one theory is shown to be better than another one, it does not necessarily mean that the statistical version of the formal theory will perform better for structure prediction.</S>
			<S sid ="768" ssid = "73">System performance is more tightly related to the efficacy of the learning and search algorithms, and feature engineering on top of the selected formalism.</S>
			<S sid ="769" ssid = "74">7.2.3 Cross-Language Evaluation: All Languages We conclude with an overall outlook of the TedEval scores across all languages.</S>
			<S sid ="770" ssid = "75">The results on the gold scenario, for the small training set and the 5k test set are presented in Table 10.</S>
			<S sid ="771" ssid = "76">We concentrate on gold scenarios (to avoid the variation in coverage of external morphological analyzers) and choose unlabeled metrics as they are not sensitive to label set sizes.</S>
			<S sid ="772" ssid = "77">We emphasize in bold, for each parsing system (row in the table), the top two languages that most accurately parsed by it (boldface) and the two languages it performed the worse on (italics).</S>
			<S sid ="773" ssid = "78">We see that the European languages German and Hungarian are parsed most accurately in the constituency-based setup, with Polish and Swedish having an advantage in dependency parsing.</S>

			<S sid ="781" ssid = "86">It appears that on a typological scale, Semitic and Asian languages are still harder to parse than a range of European languages in terms of structural difficulty and complex morpho-syntactic interaction.</S>
			<S sid ="782" ssid = "87">That said, note that we cannot tell why certain treebanks appear more challenging to parse then others, and it is still unclear whether the difficulty is inherent on the language, in the currently available models, or because of the annotation scheme and treebank consistency.43 43 The latter was shown to be an important factor orthogonal to the morphologically-rich nature of the treebank’s language 8 Conclusion.</S>
			<S sid ="783" ssid = "88">This paper presents an overview of the first shared task on parsing morphologically rich languages.</S>
			<S sid ="784" ssid = "89">The task features nine languages, exhibiting different linguistic phenomena and varied morphological complexity.</S>
			<S sid ="785" ssid = "90">The shared task saw submissions from seven teams, and results produced by more than 14 different systems.</S>
			<S sid ="786" ssid = "91">The parsing results were obtained in different input scenarios (gold, predicted, and raw) and evaluated using different protocols (cross-framework, cross-scenario, and cross-language).</S>
			<S sid ="787" ssid = "92">In particular, this is the first time an evaluation campaign reports on the execution of parsers in realistic, morphologically ambiguous, setting.</S>
			<S sid ="788" ssid = "93">The best performing systems were mostly ensemble systems combining multiple parser outputs from different frameworks or training runs, or integrating a state-of-the-art morphological analyzer on top of a carefully designed feature set.</S>
			<S sid ="789" ssid = "94">This is consistent with previous shared tasks such as ConLL 2007 or SANCL’2012.</S>
			<S sid ="790" ssid = "95">However, dealing with ambiguous morphology is still difficult for all systems, and a promising approach, as demonstrated by AL- PAGE:DYALOG, is to deal with parsing and morphology jointly by allowing lattice input to the parser.</S>
			<S sid ="791" ssid = "96">A promising generalization of this approach would be the full integration of all levels of analysis that are mutually informative into a joint model.</S>
			<S sid ="792" ssid = "97">The information to be gathered from the results of this shared task is vast, and we only scratched the surface with our preliminary analyses.</S>
			<S sid ="793" ssid = "98">We uncovered and documented insights of strategies that make parsing systems successful: parser combination is empirically proven to reach a robust performance across languages, though language-specific strategies are still a sound avenue for obtaining high quality parsers for that individual language.</S>
			<S sid ="794" ssid = "99">The integration of morphological analysis into the parsing needs to be investigated thoroughly, and new approaches that are morphologically aware need to be developed.</S>
			<S sid ="795" ssid = "100">Our cross-parser, cross-scenario, and cross- framework evaluation protocols have shown that, as expected, more data is better, and that performance on gold morphological input is significantly higher than that in more realistic scenarios.</S>
			<S sid ="796" ssid = "101">We have shown that gold morphological information is more help (Schluter and van Genabith, 2007) ful to some languages and parsers than others, and that it may also interact with successful identification of multiword expressions.</S>
			<S sid ="797" ssid = "102">We have shown that differences between dependency and constituency are smaller than previously assumed and that properties of the learning model and granularity of the output labels are more influential.</S>
			<S sid ="798" ssid = "103">Finally, we observed that languages which are typologically farthest from English, such as Semitic and Asian languages, are still amongst the hardest to parse, regardless of the parsing method used.</S>
			<S sid ="799" ssid = "104">Our cross-treebank, in-depth analysis is still preliminary, owing to the limited time between the end of the shared task and the deadline for publication of this overview.</S>
			<S sid ="800" ssid = "105">but we nonetheless feel that our findings may benefit researchers who aim to develop parsers for diverse treebanks.44 A shared task is an inspection of the state of the art, but it may also accelerate research in an area by providing a stable data basis as well as a set of strong baselines.</S>
			<S sid ="801" ssid = "106">The results produced in this task give a rich picture of the issues associated with parsing MRLs and initial cues towards their resolution.</S>
			<S sid ="802" ssid = "107">This set of results needs to be further analyzed to be fully understood, which will in turn contribute to new insights.</S>
			<S sid ="803" ssid = "108">We hope that this shared task will provide inspiration for the design and evaluation of future parsing systems for these languages.</S>
