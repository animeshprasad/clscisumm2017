			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">Discourse structures cannot always be described completely, either because they are ambiguous (Stede, 2004), or because a discourse parser fails to analyse them completely.</S>
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">In either case, underspecification formalisms (UFs) can be used to represent partial information on discourse structure.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">UFs are used in semantics to model structural ambiguity without disjunctive enumeration of the readings (van Deemter and Peters, 1996).</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Underspecified descriptions of discourse must handle two kinds of incomplete information, on the configuration of discourse segments (how they combine into larger units), and on the discourse relations that bring about this configuration: Our corpus studies on the RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2002) showed interdependencies between relations and configuration, a phenomenon first noted by (CorstonOliver, 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">These interdependencies can be formulated as constraints that contribute to the disambiguation of underspecified descriptions of discourse structure.</S>

			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">In most cases, Purpose(1) has a discourse atom as its nucleus.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">The corpus evaluation furthermore shows that those patterns never occur exclusively but only as tendencies.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Realised as soft constraints, such tendencies can help to sort the set of readings according to the established preferences, which allows to focus on the best reading or the n-best readings.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">This is of high value for an UF-based approach to discourse structure, which must cope with extremely high numbers of readings.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">To model interdependency constraints, we will use Regular Tree Grammars (RTGs) (Comon et al., 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">RTGs can straightforwardly be extended to weighted Regular Tree Grammars (wRTGs), which can represent both soft and hard constraints.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">Apart from our corpus-extracted examples, we also consider a hard interdependency constraint similar to the Right Frontier Constraint.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">We show that we can integrate this attachment constraint with our formalism, and how its representation depends on the expressiveness of RTGs.</S>

	<SECTION title="Underspecified Discourse Structure. " number = "2">
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "1">We describe (partial) information on discourse structure by expressions of a suitable UF, here, dominance graphs (Althaus et al., 2003).</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "2">Consider e.g. Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "3">1(a), the dominance graph for (1): (1) [C1 I try to read a novel] [C2 if I feel bored] [C3 because the TV programs disappoint me] [C4 but I can’t concentrate on anything.]</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "4">1 Following Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988), most discourse relations have a central nucleus argument, and a peripheral satellite argument.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "5">For Condition, the premiss is the satellite, the nucleus, the conclusion.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "6">2 ‘(n)’ as part of a relation name indicates that the nucleus is its nth argument; relations with names without such an affix are multinuclear, i.e., link two segments of equal prominence.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "7">We sometimes omit the numbers where the position of the nucleus is clear from the context.</S>

			<S sid ="29" ssid = "9">1 Such constraints describe a set of discourse structures (formalised as binary tree structures).</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "10">Their key ingredient are (reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric) dominance relations, which are indicated by dotted lines.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "11">Dominance of X1 over X2 means that X2 is part of the structure below (and including) X1, but there might be additional material intervening between X1 and X2.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "12">Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "13">1(a) states that C1 is linked to a part of the following discourse (including at least C2) by Condition, Cause(2) connects two discourse segments (comprising at least C2 and C3, respectively), and Contrast links a discourse segment to its left (including at least C3) to C4.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "14">This constraint describes (is compatible with) exactly the five tree structures in Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "15">1(b-f), if described tree structures may only comprise material that is already introduced in the constraint.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "16">They model the potential discourse structures for (1) (see Webber (2004)).</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "17">Dominance graphs like Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "18">1a.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "19">are pure chains.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "20">Pure chains describe all binary trees with the same leaf language, here the discourse segments, in their textual order.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "21">Pure chains define a left-to-right order, in that not only the leaves always form the same sequence, but also the inner nodes: If a labelled node X is further to the left in the chain than another node Y, in every described tree, X will either be Y’s left child, or Y will be X’s right child, or there will be a fragment F of which X is a successor on the left and Y is a right successor.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "22">Henceforth we will refer to fragments with their index in the chain (indicated by encircled numbers in Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "23">1a).</S>

	<SECTION title="Representing Soft Interdependencies. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "1">The interdependency constraint for Condition(1) is that its satellite tends to be maximally short, i.e., mostly consists of only one discourse atom, and in most remaining cases, of two atoms.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "2">Thus, (b) and (d) are preferred among the configurations in Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "3">1, (c) is less preferred, and (e) and (f) are the least preferred.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "4">Regular Tree Grammars (RTGs) as UF (Koller et al., 2008) can express such complex constraints straightforwardly, and provide a convenient framework to process them.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "5">They allow to extract a best configuration with standard algorithms very efficiently.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "6">Koller et al.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "7">(2008) show how to generate an RTG describing the same set of trees as a dominance graph.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "8">Similar to a context free grammar, an RTG uses production rules with terminal symbols and nonterminal symbols (NTs), whereby the left- hand side (LHS) is always a nonterminal and the right-hand side (RHS) contains at least one terminal symbol.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "9">One NT is the start symbol.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "10">A tree is accepted by the grammar if the grammar contains a derivation for it.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "11">An example for an RTG is given in Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "12">2, which describes the same trees as the dominance graph in Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "13">1a.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "14">The start symbol is {17}.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "15">To derive e.g. the tree in Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "16">1d, we first select the rule {17} → Cause({13}, {57}) that determines Condition as root for the whole tree.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "17">The left child of Condition is then derived from {17}, and the right child from {57} respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "18">To emphasize the association with the dominance graph, we mark nonterminals as the subgraphs they represent, e.g., {17} denotes the whole graph.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "19">The terminal in the RHS of a grammar rule determines the root of the LHS subgraph.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "20">Koller et al.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "21">(2008) also use weighted RTGs (wRTGs, an extension of RTG with weights) to express soft dominance constraints (which, unlike hard constraints, do not restrict but rather rank the set of configurations).</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "22">We use wRTGs to model the soft interdependency constraints.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "23">The grammar in Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "24">2 is also a wRTG that assigns a weight to each derived tree: Its weight is the product over all weights of all rules used for the derivation.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "25">Weights appear in squared brackets after the rules.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "26">The (merely expository) weights in our example encode the preference of Condition for a maximally short right child: There are three grammar rules that establish Condition as the root of a sub- graph (shaded in Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "27">2), which are distinguished by the size of the right child of the root (one ({3}), three ({35}) or five ({37}) nodes).</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "28">The shorter the right child, the higher the weight associated with the rule.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "29">(1 is a neutral weight by definition.)</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "30">The grammar thus assigns different weights to the trees in Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "31">1; (b) and (d) get the maximum weight of 9, (b), a medium weight of 3, and (e) and (f), the lowest weight of 1.</S>

	<SECTION title="Expressive Power of RTGs. " number = "4">
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "1">As Koller et al.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "2">(2008) show, the expressive power of RTGs is superior to other common underspecification formalism.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "3">We show an important application of the increased expressiveness with Ex.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "4">2, where a. can be continued by b. but not by c: (2) a. [C1 Max and Mary are falling apart.]</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "5">[C2 They no longer meet for lunch.]</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "6">[C3 And, last night, Max went to the pub] [C4 but Mary visited her parents.]</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "7">b. [C5a She complained bitterly about his behaviour.]</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "8">c. [C5b He left after his fifth pint of lager.]</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "9">Segment C5a continues the preceding clause about Mary’s visit with additional information about the visit, it thus attaches directly to C4.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "10">To find a coherent integration of C5b, we would have to connect it to C3, as it provides more details about Max’ night at the pub.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "11">However, in the given constellation of C3 and C4, that form a Contrast together, C3 is not available any longer for attachment of further discourse units.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "12">(This constraint is reminiscent of the Right Frontier Constraint, as it is used by Asher and Lascarides (2003).</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "13">However, it is unclear how the Right Frontier Constraint in its exact definition can carry over to binary trees.)</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "14">The given attachment constraint is not expressible with dominance graphs: it excludes the configurations of its dominance graph (Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "15">3) in which Contrast shows up as a direct left child, e.g., (3b/e/f) as opposed to (3c/d).</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "16">For instance, the excluded structure emerges in (3e/f) by choosing Cause as root of the the subgraph 59 (i.e., including the Contrast- and Sequence-fragments).</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "17">For convenience, we will talk about this constraint as the ”left child constraint” (LCC).</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "18">S → C ontrast(S, S) L → Evid(S, S) S → Sequ(L, S) L → List(S, S) S → L L → C1 L → C2 L → C3 L → C4 L → C5 Figure 5: A filter RTG corresponding to Ex.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "19">2 This additional constraint, however, can be expressed by an RTG like Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "20">4.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "21">We explicitly distinguish between subgraphs (referred to with numbers) and their associated NTs here.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "22">Crucially, some subgraphs can be processed in different derivations here, e.g., {59} (as right child of List, irrespective of the relative scope of Evidence and List), or {37} (in the expansions of both {EvLiC o} and {LiC oSe}, like in (3c) as opposed to (3d)).</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "23">Sometimes this derivation history is irrelevant, like in the case of {59} (here, only Contrast may be chosen as root anyway), but there are cases where it matters: If {37} is the left child of Sequence, as in (3b/d), the choice of Contrast as its root is excluded, since this would make Contrast the left child of Sequence, as in (3b).</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "24">In contrast, {37} as the right child of Evidence, like in (3c), allows both Contrast and List as root, because Contrast emerges as a right child in either case.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "25">Thus, the two occurrences of {37} are distinguished in terms of different NTs in the grammar, and only in the NT for the latter occurrence is there more than one further expansion rule.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "26">Regular tree languages are closed under intersection.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "27">Thus, one can derive a grammar like Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "28">4 by intersecting a completely underspecified RTG (here, the one derived from Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "29">3a) with a suitable filter grammar, e.g., Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "30">4.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "31">The filter grammar produces an infinite language, containing the fragments of Fig.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "32">3a and excluding any derivation in which Sequence is the direct parent of Contrast.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "33">This is guaranteed by introducing the nonterminal L (the left child NT for Sequence), for which there is no derivation with Contrast as its root.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "34">For an arbitrary pure chain with n fragments, the filter grammar generating the LCC is constructed as follows: S is the start symbol.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "35">For every fragment i s.t. 0 &lt; i &lt; n, there is a derivation rule with S as its LHS and i in its RHS, thus either S → i, for singleton fragments, or S → i(A, S), for binary fragments.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "36">If i is binary, we must determine A: If there is at least one fragment f &lt; i s.t. the LCC is assumed for f , we create a new NT Li; every derivation rule with i on its RHS follows the pattern X → i(Li, S) (thus A = Li in particular).</S>
