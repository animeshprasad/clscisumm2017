			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">The focus tasks of this paper are two related problems in lexical ambiguity resolution: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Context- Sensitive Spelling Correction (CSSC).</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">Word Sense Disambiguation has a long history as a computational task (Kelly and Stone, 1975), and the field has recently supported large-scale international system evaluation exercises in multiple languages (SEN SEVA L-1, Kilgarriff and Palmer (2000), and SEN SEVA L-2, Edmonds and Cotton (2001)).</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">General purpose Spelling Correction is also a long-standing task (e.g. McIlroy, 1982), traditionally focusing on resolving typographical errors such as transposition and deletion to find the closest “valid” word (in a dictionary or a morphological variant), typically ignoring context.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Yet Kukich (1992) observed that about 2550% of the spelling errors found in modern documents are either context-inappropriate misuses or substitutions of valid words (such as principal and principle) which are not detected by traditional spelling cor rectors.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Previous work has addressed the problem of CSSC from a machine learning perspective, including Bayesian and Decision List models (Golding, 1995), Winnow (Golding and Roth, 1996) and Transformation-Based Learning (Mangu and Brill, 1997).</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">Generally, both tasks involve the selection between a relatively small set of alternatives per keyword (e.g. sense id’s such as church/BU ILD IN G and church/IN STITU T IO N or commonly confused spellings such as quiet and quite), and are dependent on local and long-distance collocational and syntactic patterns to resolve between the set of alternatives.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Thus both tasks can share a common feature space, data representation and algorithm infrastructure.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">We present a framework of doing so, while investigating the use of mixture models in conjunction with a new error-correction technique as competitive alternatives to Bayesian models.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">While several authors have observed the fundamental similarities between CSSC and WSD (e.g. Berleant, 1995 and Roth, 1998), to our knowledge no previous comparative empirical study has tackled these two problems in a single unified framework.</S>

			<S sid ="14" ssid = "1">The problem of lexical disambiguation can be modeled as a classification task, in which each instance of the word to be disambiguated (target word, henceforth), identified by its context, has to be labeled with one of the established sense labels .1 The approaches we investigate are statistical methods , outputting conditional probability distributions over thesense set given a context . The classifica tion of a context is generally made by choosing, but we also present an alterna 1 In the case of spelling correction, the classification labels are represented by the confusion set rather than sense labels (for example ).</S>

			<S sid ="17" ssid = "4">The contexts are represented as a collection of features.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "5">Previous work in WSD and CSSC (Golding, 1995; Bruce et al., 1996; Yarowsky, 1996; Golding and Roth, 1996; Pedersen, 1998) has found diverse feature types to be useful, including inflected words, lemmas and part-of-speech (POS) in a variety of collocational and syntactic relationships, including local bigrams and trigrams, Figure 2: Example context for the spelling confusion set {piece,peace} and extracted features</S>

	<SECTION title="Mixture Models (MM). " number = "3">
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "1">We investigate in this Section a direct statistical model that uses the same starting point as the algorithm presented in Walker (1987).</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "2">We then compare the functionality and the performance of this model to those of the widely used Naïve Bayes model for the WSD task (Gale et al., 1992; Mooney, 1996; Pedersen, 1998), enhanced with the full richer feature space beyond the traditional unordered bag-of- words.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "3">predicate-argument relationships, and wide-context bag-of-words associations.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "4">Examples of the feature types we employ are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "5">The syntactic features are intended to capture the predicate-argument relationships in the syntactic window in which the target word occurs.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "6">Different relations are considered depending on Algorithm 1 Naïve Bayes Model (1) (2) the target word’s POS.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "7">For nouns, these relations are: verb-object, subject-verb, modifier-noun, and noun-modified_noun; for verbs: verb-object, verb- particle/preposition, verb-prepositional_object; for adjectives: modifying_adjective-noun.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "8">Also, words with the same POS as the target word that are linked to the target word by coordinating conjunctions are extracted as sibling features.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "9">The extraction process is performed using simple heuristic patterns and regular expressions over the POS environment.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "10">As Figure 2 shows, we considered for the CSSC task the POS bigrams of the immediate left and right word pairs as additional features in order to solve POS ambiguity and capture more of the syntactic environment in which the target word occurs (the elements of a confusion set often have disjoint or very different syntactic functions).</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "11">It is known that Bayes decision rule is optimal if the distribution of the data of each class is known (Duda and Hart, 1973, ch.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "12">2).</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "13">However, the class- conditional distributions of the data are not known and have to be estimated.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "14">Both Naïve Bayes and the mixture model we investigated estimate starting from mathematically correct formulations, and thus would be equivalent if the assumptions they make were correct.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "15">Naïve Bayes makes the assumption (used to transform Equation (1) into (2)) that the features are conditionally independent given a sense label.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "16">The mixture model makes a similar assumption, by regarding a document as being completely described by a union of independent features (Equation (3)).</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "17">In practice, these are not true.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "18">Given the strong correlation and common redun dancy of the features in the case of WSD-related tasks, in conjunction with the limited training data on which the probabilities are estimated and the high dimensionality of the feature space, these assumptions lead to substantial modeling problems.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "19">Another important observation is that very many of the frequencies involved in the probability estimation are zero because of the very sparse feature space.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "20">Naïve Bayes depends heavily on probabilities not being zero and therefore it has to rely on smoothing.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "21">On the other hand, the mixture model is more robust to unseen events, without the need for explicit smoothing.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "22">Under the proposed mixture model, the conditional probability of a sense given a target wordin a context is estimated as a mixture of the condi tional sense probability distributions for individual context features: Algorithm 2 Mixture Model (3) (4) to regardless of the distance then MLE estimates are obtained.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "23">There are various other ways of choosing the weighting measure . One natural way is to transform the distance into a closeness measure by considering (Manning and Schütze, 1999, ch.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "24">14.1).</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "25">This measure proves to be effective for the spelling correction task, where the words in the immediate vicinity are far more important than the rest of the context words2 , but imposes counterproductive differences between the much wider context positions (such as +30 vs. +31) used in WSD, especially when considering large context windows.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "26">Experimental results indicate that it is more effective to level outthe local positional differences given by a continu ous weighting, by instead using weight-equivalent regions which can be described with a simple step- function , ( is a constant3 ).</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "27">A filtering process based on the overall importance of a word for the disambiguation of is also employed, using alterations of the form , with proportional to the number of senses of target word which it co occurs with in the training set.4 In this way, the words that occur only once in the training set, as as opposed to the Naïve Bayes model in which the probability of a sense given a context is derived from the prior probability of weighted by the conditional probabilities of the contextual features given the sense.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "28">The probabilities in (4) and in (2) can be computed as maximum likelihood estimates (MLE), by counting the co-occurrences of and versus the occurrences of , respectively in the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "29">An extension to this classical estimation method is to use distance-weighted counts instead of raw counts for the relative frequencies: (5) (6) denotes the training contexts of word and the subset of corresponding to sense . When is a syntactic headword, is computed by raw count.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "30">When is a context word, is computed as a function of the position of the target word in and the positions where occurs in : . If are set well as those that occur with most of the senses of a word, providing no relevant information about the sense itself, are penalized.</S>

	<SECTION title="Classification Correction and Boosting. " number = "4">
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "1">We first present an original classification correction method based on the variation of posterior probability estimates across data and then the adaptation of the Adaboost method (Freund and Schapire, 1997) to the task of lexical classification.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "2">4.1 The Maximum Variance Correction.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "3">Method (MVC) One problem arising from the sparseness of training data is that mixture models tend to excessively favor the best represented senses in the training set.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "4">A probable cause is that spurious words, which can not be considered general stopwords but do not carry sense-disambiguation information for a particular target word, may occur only by chance both in training and test data.6 Another cause is the fact that mixture models search for decision surfaces linear in the feature space7 ; therefore, they can not make only correct classifications (unless the feature space can be divided by linear conditions) and the samples for the under-represented senses are likely to be interpreted as outliers.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "5">To address this estimation problem, a second classification step is employed, based on the observation that the deviation of a component of the posterior distribution from its expected value (as computed over the training set) can be as relevant as the maximum of the distribution . Instead of classifying each test context independently after estimating its sense probability distribution, we classify it by comparing it with the whole spaceof training contexts, for which the posterior distri butions are computed using a jackknife procedure.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "6">Figure 4(a) illustrates such an example: each line in the table represents the posterior distribution over senses given a context, each column contains the values corresponding to a particular sense in the posterior distributions of all contexts.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "7">Intuitively, sense may be preferred to the most likely sense for the test context despite the fact that the is smaller than because of the analogy with and the “expected values” of the components corresponding to and . Unfortunately, we face again the problem of under-representation in the training data: the expected values in the posterior distributions for the under-represented senses when they express the correct classification can not be accurately estimated.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "8">Therefore, we have to look at the problem from another angle.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "9">6 For example, assuming that every context contains approximately the same number of such words, then given two senses, one represented in the training set by 20 examples, and the other one by 4, it is five times more likely that a spurious word in a test context co-occurs with the larger sampled sense.</S>

			<S sid ="131" ssid = "58">A sense with a high variational coefficient is preferred to the mode of the MM distribution (the fields corresponding to the true sense are highlighted) The mathematical support is provided by Chebyshev’s inequality , which allows us to place an upper bound on the probability that the value of a random variable is larger than a set value, given the mean and variance of . Considering a finite selection from a distribution for which and exist and can be estimated8 as the empirical mean and empirical variance , and given another set , the elements of that are least probable as being generated from are those for which the variational coefficients are large.</S>
			<S sid ="132" ssid = "59">To apply this assumption to the disambiguation task, a set containing the values for all contexts in the training set that are not labeled is built for every sense (see Figure 4(a)).</S>
			<S sid ="133" ssid = "60">In this way, the problem of poor representation of some senses is overcome and the selections are large for all senses.</S>
			<S sid ="134" ssid = "61">An instance in the test set is considered more likely to correspond to a sense if the estimated value is an outlier with respect to (see Figure 4(b)) and thus it is viewed as a candidate for having its classification changed to . Assuming that the selections are representative and there exist first and second order moments for the underlying distributions (conditions which we call “good statistical properties”), an improvement in the accuracy of the classifier can be expected when choosing a sense with a variational coefficient instead of the clas sifier distribution’s mode (if such a sense exists).</S>
			<S sid ="135" ssid = "62">For example, knowing that the performance of the mixture model for SEN SEVA L-2 is 8 It is hard to judge how well estimated these statistics are without making any distributional assumptions.</S>
			<S sid ="136" ssid = "63">approximatively , the threshold for variational coefficients is set to . Because spurious words not only favor the better represented senses in the training set, but also can affect the variational coefficients of unlikely senses, some restrictions had to be imposed in our implementation to avoid the other extreme of favoring unlikely senses.</S>
			<S sid ="137" ssid = "64">The mixture model does not guarantee the requirements imposed by the MVC method are met, but it has the advantage over the Bayesian model that each of the components of the posterior distribution it computes can be seen as a weighted mixture of random variables corresponding to the individual features.</S>
			<S sid ="138" ssid = "65">In the simplest case, when considering binary features, these variables are Bernoulli trials.</S>
			<S sid ="139" ssid = "66">Furthermore, if the trials have the same probability-mass function then a component of the posterior distribution will follow a binomial distribution, and therefore would have good statistical properties.</S>

			<S sid ="142" ssid = "69">AdaBoost is an iterative boosting algorithm introduced by Freund and Schapire (1997) shown to be successful for several natural language classification tasks.</S>
			<S sid ="143" ssid = "70">AdaBoost successively builds classifiers based on a weak learner (base learning algorithm) by weighting differently the examples in the training space, and outputs the final classification by mixing the predictions of the iteratively built classifiers.</S>
			<S sid ="144" ssid = "71">Because sense disambiguation is a multi-class problem, we chose to use version AdaBoost.M2.</S>
			<S sid ="145" ssid = "72">We could not apply AdaBoost straightforwardly to the problem of sense disambiguation because of the high dimensionality and sparseness of the fea ture space.</S>
			<S sid ="146" ssid = "73">Superficial modeling of the training set can easily be achieved because of the singularity/rarity of many feature values in the context space, but this largely represents overfitting of the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="147" ssid = "74">In order to solve this problem, we use AdaBoost in conjunction with jackknife and a partial updating technique.</S>
			<S sid ="148" ssid = "75">At each round, classifiers are built using as training all the examples in the training set except the one to be classified, and the weights are updated at feature level rather than context level.</S>

			<S sid ="229" ssid = "1">We investigated the properties and performance of mixture models and two augmenting methods in an unified framework for Word Sense Disambiguation and Context-Sensitive Spelling Correction, showing experimentally that such joint models can successfully match and exceed the performance of feature- enhanced Bayesian models.</S>
			<S sid ="230" ssid = "2">The new classification correction method (MVC) we propose successfully addresses the problem of under-estimation of less likely classes, consistently and significantly improving the performance of the main mixture model across all tasks and languages.</S>
			<S sid ="231" ssid = "3">Finally, since the mixture model and its improvements performed well on two major tasks and several multilingual data sets, we believe that they can be productively applied to other related high-dimensionality lexical classification problems, including named-entity classification, topic classification, and lexical choice in machine translation.</S>
