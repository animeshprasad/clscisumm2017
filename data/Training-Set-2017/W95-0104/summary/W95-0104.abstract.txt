<S sid ="0">A Bayesian hybrid method for context-sensitive spelling correction</S>
<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">Two classes of methods have been shown to be useful for resolving lexical ambiguity.</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">The first relies on the presence of particular words within some distance of the ambiguous target word; the second uses the pattern of words and part-of-speech tags around the target word.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">These methods have complementary coverage: the former captures the lexical &quot;atmosphere&quot; (discourse topic, tense, etc.), while the latter captures local syntax.</S>
<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">Yarowsky has exploited this complementarity by combining the two methods using decision lists.</S>
<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">The idea is to pool the evidence provided by the component methods, and to then solve a target problem by applying the single strongest piece of evidence, whatever type it happens to be.</S>
<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">This paper takes Yarowsky&apos;s work as a starting point, applying decision lists to the problem of context-sensitive spelling correction.</S>
<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Decision lists are found, by and large, to outperform either component method.</S>
<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">However, it is found that further improvements can be obtained by taking into account not just the single strongest piece of evidence, but all the available evidence.</S>
<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">A new hybrid method, based on Bayesian classifiers, is presented for doing this, and its performance improvements are demonstrated.</S>
