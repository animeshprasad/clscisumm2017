<S sid="0">Unsupervised Learning of Contextual Role Knowledge for Coreference Resolution</S>
<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">We present a coreference resolver called BABAR that uses contextual role knowledge to evaluate possible antecedents for an anaphor.</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">BABAR uses information extraction patterns to identify contextual roles and creates four contextual role knowledge sources using unsupervised learning.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">These knowledge sources determine whether the contexts surrounding an anaphor and antecedent are compatible.</S>
<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">BABAR applies a DempsterShafer probabilistic model to make resolutions based on evidence from the contextual role knowledge sources as well as general knowledge sources.</S>
<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Experiments in two domains showed that the contextual role knowledge improved coreference performance, especially on pronouns.</S>
