<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">Boxer is an open-domain tool for computing and reasoning with semantic representations.</S>
<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Based on Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), Boxer is able to construct Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs for short, informally called “boxes” because of the way they are graphically displayed) for English sentences and texts.</S>
<S sid ="17" ssid = "5">Because the syntax-semantics is clearly defined, the choice of logical form can be independent of the categorial framework underlying it.</S>
<S sid ="23" ssid = "11">We choose DRT because it has established itself as a well- documented formal theory of meaning, covering a number of semantic phenomena ranging from pronouns, abstract anaphora, presupposition, tense and aspect, propositional attitudes, to plurals (Kamp and Reyle, 1993; Asher, 1993; Van der Sandt, 1992)
<S sid ="144" ssid = "37">The numerical and date expressions got correct representations.</S>
<S sid ="156" ssid = "2">It takes as input a CCG derivation of a natural language expression, and produces formally interpretable semantic representations: either in the form of DRSs, or as formulas of first-order logic.</S>
