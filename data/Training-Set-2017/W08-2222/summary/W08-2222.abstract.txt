<S sid ="0">Wide-Coverage Semantic Analysis with Boxer</S>
<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">Boxer is an open-domain software component for semantic analysis of text, based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) and Discourse Representation Theory (DRT).</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">Used together with the C&amp;C tools, Boxer reaches more than 95% coverage on newswire texts.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">The semantic representations produced by Boxer, known as Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs), incorporate a neoDavidsonian representations for events, using the VerbNet inventory of thematic roles.</S>
<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">The resulting DRSs can be translated to ordinary first-order logic formulas and be processing by standard theorem provers for first-order logic.</S>
<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Boxer’s performance on the shared task for comparing semantic represtations was promising.</S>
<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">It was able to produce complete DRSs for all seven texts.</S>
<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Manually inspecting the output revealed that: (a) the computed predicate argument structure was generally of high quality, in particular dealing with hard constructions involving control or coordination; (b) discourse structure triggered by conditionals, negation or discourse adverbs was overall correctly computed; (c) some measure and time expressions are correctly analysed, others aren’t; (d) several shallow analyses are given for lexical phrases that require deep analysis; (e) bridging references and pronouns are not resolved in most cases.</S>
<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Boxer is distributed with the C&amp;C tools and freely available for research purposes.</S>
