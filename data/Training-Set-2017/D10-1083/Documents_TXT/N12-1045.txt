Abstract
In this paper we present a fully unsupervised
nonparametric Bayesian model that jointly in-
duces POS tags and morphological segmen-
tations. The model is essentially an infi-
nite HMM that infers the number of states
from data. Incorporating segmentation into
the same model provides the morphological
features to the system and eliminates the need
to find them during preprocessing step. We
show that learning both tasks jointly actually
leads to better results than learning either task
with gold standard data from the other task
provided. The evaluation on multilingual data
shows that the model produces state-of-the-art
results on POS induction.
1 Introduction
Nonparametric Bayesian modeling has recently be-
come very popular in natural language processing
(NLP), mostly because of its ability to provide pri-
ors that are especially suitable for tasks in NLP (Teh,
2006). Using nonparametric priors enables to treat
the size of the model as a random variable with its
value to be induced during inference which makes
its use very appealing in models that need to decide
upon the number of states.
The task of unsupervised parts-of-speech (POS)
tagging has been under research in numerous pa-
pers, for overview see (Christodoulopoulos et al,
2010). Most of the POS induction models use the
structure of hidden Markov model (HMM) (Rabiner,
1989) that requires the knowledge about the num-
ber of hidden states (corresponding to the number
of tags) in advance. According to our consider-
ations, supplying this information is not desirable
for two opposing reasons: 1) it injects into the sys-
tem a piece of knowledge which in a truly unsu-
pervised setting would be unavailable; and 2) the
number of POS tags used is somewhat arbitrary any-
way because there is no common consensus of what
should be the true number of tags in each language
and therefore it seems unreasonable to constrain the
model with such a number instead of learning it from
the data.
Unsupervised morphology learning is another
popular task that has been extensively studied by
many authors. Here we are interested in learning
concatenative morphology of words, meaning the
substrings of the word corresponding to morphemes
that, when concatenated, will give the lexical repre-
sentation of the word type. For the rest of the paper
we will refer to this task as (morphological) segmen-
tation.
Several unsupervised POS induction systems
make use of morphological features (Blunsom and
Cohn, 2011; Lee et al, 2010; Berg-Kirkpatrick et
al., 2010; Clark, 2003; Christodoulopoulos et al,
2011) and this approach has been empirically proved
to be helpful (Christodoulopoulos et al, 2010). In a
similar fashion one could think that knowing POS
tags could be useful for learning morphological seg-
mentations and in this paper we will study this hy-
pothesis.
In this paper we will build a model that combines
POS induction and morphological segmentation into
one learning problem. We will show that the unsu-
pervised learning of both of these tasks in the same
407
model will lead to better results than learning both
tasks separately with the gold standard data of the
other task provided. We will also demonstrate that
our model produces state-of-the-art results on POS
tagging. As opposed to the compared methods, our
model also induces the number of tags from data.
In the following, section 2 gives the overview
of the Dirichlet Processes, section 3 describes the
model setup followed by the description of infer-
ence procedures in section 4, experimental results
are presented in section 5, section 6 summarizes the
previous work and last section concludes the paper.
2 Background
2.1 Dirichlet Process
Let H be a distribution called base measure. Dirich-
let process (DP) (Ferguson, 1973) is a probability
distribution over distributions whose support is the
subset of the support of H:
G ? DP (?,H), (1)
where ? is the concentration parameter that controls
the number of values instantiated by G.
DP has no analytic form and therefore other rep-
resentations must be developed for sampling. In the
next section we describe Chinese Restaurant Process
that enables to obtain samples from DP.
2.2 Chinese Restaurant Process
Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) (Aldous, 1985)
enables to calculate the marginal probabilities of the
elements conditioned on the values given to all pre-
viously seen items and integrating over possible DP
prior values.
Imagine an infinitely big Chinese restaurant with
infinitely many tables with each table having ca-
pacity for infinitely many customers. In the begin-
ning the restaurant is empty. Then customers, corre-
sponding to data points, start entering one after an-
other. The first customer chooses an empty table to
sit at. Next customers choose a new table with prob-
ability proportional to the concentration parameter
? or sit into one of the already occupied tables with
probability proportional to the number of customers
already sitting there. Whenever a customer chooses
an empty table, he will also pick a dish from H to
be served on that table. The predictive probability
distribution over dishes for the i-th customer is:
P (xi = ?k|x?i, ?,H) =
n?k + ?
i? 1 + ?pH(?k), (2)
where x?i is the seating arrangement of customers
excluding the i-th customer and n?k is the number of
customers eating dish ?k and pH(?) is the probability
according to H .
2.3 Hierarchical Dirichlet Process
The notion of hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP)
(Teh et al, 2006) can be derived by letting the base
measure itself to be a draw from a DP:
G0|?0, H ? DP (?0, H) (3)
Gj |?,G0 ? DP (?,G0) j = 1 ? ? ? J (4)
Under HDP, CRP becomes Chinese Restaurant
Franchise (Teh et al, 2006) with several restaurants
sharing the same franchise-wide menu G0. When a
customer sits at an empty table in one of the Gj-th
restaurants, the event of a new customer entering the
restaurant G0 will be triggered. Analogously, when
a table becomes empty in one of the Gj-th restau-
rants, it causes one of the customers leaving from
restaurant G0.
3 Model
We consider the problem of unsupervised learning
of POS tags and morphological segmentations in a
joint model. Similarly to some recent successful at-
tempts (Lee et al, 2010; Christodoulopoulos et al,
2011; Blunsom and Cohn, 2011), our model is type-
based, arranging word types into hard clusters. Un-
like many recent POS tagging models, our model
does not assume any prior information about the
number of POS tags. We will define the model as
a generative sequence model using the HMM struc-
ture. Graphical depiction of the model is given in
Figure 1.
3.1 Generative story
We assume the presence of a fixed length vocabu-
lary W . The process starts with generating the lex-
icon that stores for each word type its POS tag and
morphological segmentation.
408
? Draw a unigram tag distribution from the re-
spective DP;
? Draw a segment distribution from the respec-
tive DP;
? For each tag, draw a tag-specific segment distri-
bution from HDP with the segment distribution
as base measure;
? For each word type, draw a tag from the uni-
gram tag distribution;
? For each word type, draw a segmentation from
the respective tag-specific segment distribution.
Next we proceed to generate the HMM parame-
ters:
? For each tag, draw a bigram distribution from
HDP with the unigram tag distribution as base
measure;
? For each tag bigram, draw a trigram distribu-
tion from HDP with the respective bigram dis-
tribution as base measure;
? For each tag, draw a Dirichlet concentration pa-
rameter from Gamma distribution and an emis-
sion distribution from the symmetric Dirichlet.
Finally the standard HMM procedure for generat-
ing the data sequence follows. At each time step:
? Generate the next tag conditioned on the last
two tags from the respective trigram HDP;
? Generate the word from the respective emission
distribution conditioned on the tag just drawn;
? Generate the segmentation of the word deter-
ministically by looking it up from the lexicon.
3.2 Model setup
The trigram transition hierarchy is a HDP:
GU ? DP (?U , H) (5)
GBj ? DP (?B, GU ) j = 1 ? ? ?? (6)
GTjk ? DP (?T , GBj ) j, k = 1 ? ? ??, (7)
where GU , GB and GT denote the unigram, bigram
and trigram context DP-s respectively, ?-s are the

s, wi-s and si-s denote the tags, words and segmentations
respectively. G-s are various DP-s in the model, Ej-s and

distribution. S is the base distribution over segments.

respective concentration parameters coupled for DP-
s of the same hierarchy level. Emission parame-
ters are drawn from multinomials with symmetric
Dirichlet priors:
Ej |?j , H ?
?
Mult(?)Dir(?j)d? j = 1 ? ? ??,
(8)
where each emission distribution has its own Dirich-
let concentration parameter ?j drawn from H .
Morphological segments are modelled with an-
other HDP where the groups are formed on the basis
of tags:
GS ? DP (?S , S) (9)
GTSj ? DP (?TS , GS) j = 1 ? ? ??, (10)
where GTSj are the tag-specific segment DP-s and
GS is their common base distribution with S as base
measure over all possible strings. S consists of two
components: a geometric distribution over the seg-
ment lengths and collapsed Dirichlet-multinomial
over character unigrams.
4 Inference
We implemented Gibbs sampler to draw new val-
ues for tags and Metropolis-Hastings sampler for re-
sampling segmentations. We use a type-based col-
409
lapsed sampler that draws the tagging and segmen-
tation values for all tokens of a word type in one step
and integrates out the random DP measures by using
the CRP representation. The whole procedure alter-
nates between three sampling steps:
? Sampling new tag value for each word type;
? Resampling the segmentation for each type;
? Sampling new values for all parameters.
4.1 Tag sampling
The tags will be sampled from the posterior:
P (T|W,S,w,?), (11)
where W is the set of words in the vocabulary, T
and S are tags and segmentations assigned to each
word type, w is the actual word sequence, and ? de-
notes the set of all parameters relevant for tag sam-
pling. For brevity, we will omit ? notation in the
formulas below. For a single word type, this poste-
rior can be factored as follows:
P (Ti = t|T?i,S,W,w) ?
P (Si|Ti = t,T?i,S?i)?
P (Wi|Ti = t,T?i,W?i)?
P (w|Ti = t,T?i,W),
(12)
where ?i in the subscript denotes the observations
with the i-th word type excluded.
The first term is the segmentation likelihood and
can be computed according to the CRP formula:
P (Si|Ti = t,T?i,S?i) =
|Wi|?
j=1
?
s?Si
(
n?Sits
n?Sit? + ?
+ ?(m
?Si
s + ?P0(s))
(n?Sit? + ?)(m?Si? + ?)
)
,
(13)
where the outer product is over the word type count,
nts and ms denote the number of customers ?eat-
ing? the segment s under tag t and the number of
tables ?serving? the segment s across all restaurants
respectively, dot represents the marginal counts and
? and ? are the concentration parameters of the re-
spective DP-s. ?Si in upper index means that the
segments belonging to the segmentation of the i-th
word type and not calculated into likelihood term yet
have been excluded.
The word type likelihood is calculated accord-
ing to the collapsed Dirichlet-multinomial likeli-
hood formula:
P (Wi|Ti = t,T?i,W?i,w) =
|Wi|?1?
j=0
ntWi + j + ?
nt? + j + ?N
(14)
where ntWi is the number of times the word Wi has
been tagged with tag t so far, nt? is the number of
total word tokens tagged with the tag t and N is the
total number of words in the vocabulary.
The last factor is the word sequence likelihood
and covers the transition probabilities. Relevant tri-
grams are those three containing the current word,
and in all contexts where the word token appears in:
P (w|Ti = t,T?i,W) ?
?
c?CWi
P (t|t(c?2), t(c?1))?
P (t(c+1)|t(c?1), t)?
P (t(c+2)|t, t(c+1))
(15)
where CWi denotes all the contexts where the word
type Wi appears in, t(c) are the tags assigned to the
context words. All these terms can be calculated
with CRP formulas.
4.2 Segmentation sampling
We sample the whole segmentation of a word type
as a block with forward-filtering backward-sampling
scheme as described in (Mochihashi et al, 2009).
As we cannot sample from the exact marginal
conditional distribution due to the dependen-
cies between segments induced by the CRP, we
use the Metropolis-Hastings sampler that draws
a new proposal with forward-filtering backward-
sampling scheme and accepts it with probability
min(1, P (Sprop)P (Sold) ), where Sprop is the proposed seg-
mentation and Sold is the current segmentation of a
word type. The acceptance rate during experiments
varied between 94-98%.
For each word type, we build a forward filter-
ing table where we maintain the forward variables
?[t][k] that present the probabilities of the last k
characters of a t-character string constituting a seg-
ment. Define:
?[0][0] = 1 (16)
410
?[t][0] = 0, t > 0 (17)
Then the forward variables can be computed recur-
sively by using dynamic programming algorithm:
?[t][k] = p(ctt?k)
t?k?
j=0
?[t? k][j], t = 1 ? ? ?L,
(18)
where cnm denotes the characters cm ? ? ? cn of a string
c and L is the length of the word.
Sampling starts from the end of the word because
it is known for certain that the word end coincides
with the end of a segment. We sample the begin-
ning position k of the last segment from the forward
variables ?[t][k], where t is the length of the word.
Then we set t = t ? k and continue to sample the
start of the previous to the last segment. This pro-
cess continues until t = 0. The segment probabili-
ties, conditioned on the tag currently assigned to the
word type, will be calculated according to the seg-
mentation likelihood formula (13).
4.3 Hyperparameter sampling
All DP and Dirichlet concentration parameters are
given vague Gamma(10, 0.1) priors and new values
are sampled by using the auxiliary variable sampling
scheme described in (Escobar and West, 1995) and
the extended version for HDP-s described in (Teh
et al, 2006). The segment length control parame-
ter is given uniform Beta prior and its new values
are sampled from the posterior which is also a Beta
distribution.
5 Results
5.1 Evaluation
We test the POS induction part of the model on
all languages in the Multext-East corpora (Erjavec,
2010) as well as on the free corpora from CONLL-
X Shared Task1 for Dutch, Danish, Swedish and
Portuguese. The evaluation of morphological seg-
mentations is based on the Morpho Challenge gold
segmented wordlists for English, Finnish and Turk-
ish2. We gathered the sentences from Europarl cor-
pus3 for English and Finnish, and use the Turkish

text data from the Morpho Challenge 20094. Es-
tonian gold standard segmentations have been ob-
tained from the Estonian morphologically annotated
corpus5.
We report three accuracy measures for tagging:
greedy one-to-one mapping (1-1) (Haghighi and
Klein, 2006), many-to-one mapping (m-1) and V-
measure (V-m) (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007).
Segmentation is evaluated on the basis of standard
F-score which is the harmonic mean of precision and
recall.
5.2 Experimental results
For each experiment, we made five runs with ran-
dom initializations and report the results of the me-
dian. The sampler was run 200 iterations for burnin,
after which we collected 5 samples, letting the sam-
pler to run for another 200 iterations between each
two sample. We start with 15 segmenting iterations
during each Gibbs iteration to enable the segmenta-
tion sampler to burnin to the current tagging state,
and gradually reduce this number to one. Segmenta-
tion likelihood term for tagging is calculated on the
basis of the last segment only because this setting
gave the best results in preliminary experiments and
it also makes the whole computation less expensive.
The first set of experiments was conducted to test
the model tagging accuracy on different languages
mentioned above. The results obtained were in gen-
eral slightly lower than the current state-of-the-art
and the number of tags learned was generally bigger
than the number of gold standard tags. We observed
that different components making up the corpus log-
arithmic probability have different magnitudes. In
particular, we found that the emission probability
component in log-scale is roughly four times smaller
than the transition probability. This observation mo-
tivated introducing the likelihood scaling heuristic
into the model to scale the emission probability up.
We tried a couple of different scaling factors on
Multext-East English corpus and then set its value
to 4 for all languages for the rest of the experi-
ments. This improved the tagging results consis-
tently across all languages.

POS induction results are given in Table 1. When
comparing these results with the recently published
results on the same corpora (Christodoulopoulos et
al., 2011; Blunsom and Cohn, 2011; Lee et al,
2010) we can see that our results compare favorably
with the state-of-the-art, resulting with the best pub-
lished results in many occasions. The number of tag
clusters learned by the model corresponds surpris-
ingly well to the number of true coarse-grained gold
standard tags across all languages. There are two
things to note here: 1) the tag distributions learned
are influenced by the likelihood scaling heuristic and
more experiments are needed in order to fully under-
stand the characteristics and influence of this heuris-
tic; 2) as the model is learning the coarse-grained
tagset consistently in all languages, it might as well
be that the POS tags are not as dependent on the mor-
phology as we assumed, especially in inflectional
languages with many derivational and inflectional
suffixes, because otherwise the model should have
learned a more fine-grained tagset.
Segmentation results are presented in Table 2.
For each language, we report the lexicon-based pre-
cision, recall and F-measure, the number of word
types in the corpus and and number of word types
with gold segmentation available. The reported stan-
dard deviations show that the segmentations ob-
tained are stable across different runs which is prob-
ably due to the blocked sampler. We give the seg-
mentation results both with and without likelihood
scaling heuristic and denote that while the emission
likelihood scaling improves the tagging accuracy, it
actually degrades the segmentation results.
It can also be seen that in general precision score
is better but for Estonian recall is higher. This can
be explained by the characteristics of the evalua-
tion data sets. For English, Finnish and Turkish we
use the Morpho Challenge wordlists where the gold
standard segmentations are fine-grained, separating
both inflectional and derivational morphemes. Espe-
cially derivational morphemes are hard to learn with
pure data-driven methods with no knowledge about
semantics and thus it can result in undersegmenta-
tion. On the other hand, Estonian corpus separates
only inflectional morphemes which thus leads to
higher recall. Some difference can also come from
the fact that the sets of gold-segmented word types
for other languages are much smaller than in Esto-

nian and thus it would be interesting to see whether
and how the results would change if the evaluation
could be done on all word types in the corpus for
other languages as well. In general, undersegmen-
tation is more acceptable than oversegmentation, es-
pecially when the aim is to use the resulting segmen-
tations in some NLP application.
Next, we studied the convergence characteristics
of our model. For these experiments we made five
runs with random initializations on Estonian cor-
pus and let the sampler run up to 1100 iterations.
Samples were taken after each ten iterations. Fig-
ure 2 shows the log-likelihood of the samples plot-
ted against iteration number. Dark lines show the
averages over five runs and gray lines in the back-
ground are the likelihoods of real samples showing
also the variance. We first calculated the full like-
lihood of the samples (the solid line) that showed
a quick improvement during the first few iterations
and then stabilized by continuing with only slow im-
provements over time. We then divided the full like-
lihood into two factors in order to see the contribu-
tion of both tagging and segmentation parts sepa-
rately. The results are quite surprising. It turned
out that the random tagging initializations are very
good in terms of probability and as a matter of fact
much better than the data can support and thus the
tagging likelihood drops quite significantly after the
first iteration and then continues with very slow im-
provements. The matters are totally different with
segmentations where the initial random segmenta-
tions result in a low likelihood that improves heavily

studies and we leave it for future work.

mentations and POS tags help each other in the
learning process. For that we conducted two semisu-
pervised experiments on Estonian corpus. First we
provided gold standard segmentations to the model
and let it only learn the tags. Then, we gave the
model gold standard POS tags and only learned the
segmentations. The results are given in Table 3.
We also added the results from joint unusupervised
learning for easier comparison. Unfortunately we
cannot repeat this experiment on other languages
to see whether the results are stable across differ-
ent languages because to our knowledge there is no
other free corpus with both gold standard POS tags
and morphological segmentations available.
From the results it can be seen that the unsu-
pervised learning results for both tagging and seg-
mentation are better than the results obtained from
semisupervised learning. This is surprising because
one would assume that providing gold standard data
would lead to better results. On the other hand, these
results are encouraging, showing that learning two
dependent tasks in a joint model by unsupervised
manner can be as good or even better than learn-
ing the same tasks separately and providing the gold
standard data as features.
Finally, we learned the morphological segmen-
tations with the state-of-the-art morphology induc-
tion system Morfessor baseline6 (Creutz and Lagus,
2005) and report the best results in the last row of
Table 3. Apparently, our joint model cannot beat
Morfessor in morphological segmentation and when
6http://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/morpho/
using the emission likelihood scaling that influences
the tagging results favorably, the segmentation re-
sults get even worse. Altough the semisupervised
experiments showed that there are dependencies be-
tween tags and segmentations, the conducted exper-
iments do not reveal of how to use these dependen-
cies for helping the POS tags to learn better morpho-
logical segmentations.
6 Related Work
We will review some of the recent works related
to Bayesian POS induction and morphological seg-
mentation.
One of the first Bayesian POS taggers is described
in (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007). The model pre-
sented is a classical HMM with multinomial transi-
tion and emission distributions with Dirichlet priors.
Inference is done using a collapsed Gibbs sampler
and concentration parameter values are learned dur-
ing inference. The model is token-based, allowing
different words of the same type in different loca-
tions to have a different tag. This model can actu-
ally be classified as semi-supervised as it assumes
the presence of a tagging dictionary that contains
the list of possible POS tags for each word type -
an assumption that is clearly not realistic in an unsu-
pervised setting.
Models presented in (Christodoulopoulos et al,
2011) and (Lee et al, 2010) are also built on
Dirichlet-multinomials and, rather than defining a
sequence model, present a clustering model based
on features. Both report good results on type basis
and use (among others) also morphological features,
with (Lee et al, 2010) making use of fixed length
suffixes and (Christodoulopoulos et al, 2011) using
the suffixes obtained from an unsupervised morphol-
ogy induction system.
Nonparametric Bayesian POS induction has been
studied in (Blunsom and Cohn, 2011) and (Gael et
al., 2009). The model in (Blunsom and Cohn, 2011)
uses Pitman-Yor Process (PYP) prior but the model
itself is finite in the sense that the size of the tagset is
fixed. Their model also captures morphological reg-
ularities by modeling the generation of words with
character n-grams. The model in (Gael et al, 2009)
uses infinite state space with Dirichlet Process prior.
The model structure is classical HMM consisting
414
only of transitions and emissions and containing no
morphological features. Inference is done by us-
ing beam sampler introduced in (Gael et al, 2008)
which enables parallelized implementation.
One close model for morphology stems from
Bayesian word segmentation (Goldwater et al,
2009) where the task is to induce word borders from
transcribed sentences. Our segmentation model is in
principle the same as the unigram word segmenta-
tion model and the main difference is that we are us-
ing blocked sampler while (Goldwater et al, 2009)
uses point-wise Gibbs sampler by drawing the pres-
ence or absence of the word border between every
two characters.
In (Goldwater et al, 2006) the morphology is
learned in the adaptor grammar framework (John-
son et al, 2006) by using a PYP adaptor. PYP adap-
tor caches the numbers of observed derivation trees
and forces the distribution over all possible trees to
take the shape of power law. In the PYP (and also
DP) case the adaptor grammar can be interpreted as
PYP (or DP) model with regular PCFG distribution
as base measure.
The model proposed in (Goldwater et al, 2006)
makes several assumptions that we do not: 1) seg-
mentations have a fixed structure of stem and suffix;
and 2) there is a fixed number of inflectional classes.
Inference is performed with Gibbs sampler by sam-
pling for each word its stem, suffix and inflectional
class.
7 Conclusion
In this paper we presented a joint unsupervised
model for learning POS tags and morphological
segmentations with hierarchical Dirichlet Process
model. Our model induces the number of POS clus-
ters from data and does not contain any hand-tuned
parameters. We tested the model on many languages
and showed that by introcing a likelihood scaling
heuristic it produces state-of-the-art POS induction
results. We believe that the tagging results could
further be improved by adding additional features
concerning punctuation, capitalization etc. which
are heavily used in the other state-of-the-art POS in-
duction systems but these features were intentionally
left out in the current model for enabling to test the
concept of joint modelling of two dependent tasks.
We found some evidence that the tasks of POS
induction and morphological segmentation are de-
pendent by conducting semisupervised experiments
where we gave the model gold standard tags and seg-
mentations in turn and let it learn only segmentations
or tags respectively and found that the results in fully
unsupervised setting are better. Despite of that, the
model failed to learn as good segmentations as the
state-of-the-art morphological segmentation model
Morfessor. One way to improve the segmentation
results could be to use segment bigrams instead of
unigrams.
The model can serve as a basis for several further
extensions. For example, one possibility would be
to expand it into multilingual setting in a fashion of
(Naseem et al, 2009), or it could be extended to add
the joint learning of morphological paradigms of the
words given their tags and segmentations in a man-
ner described by (Dreyer and Eisner, 2011).
