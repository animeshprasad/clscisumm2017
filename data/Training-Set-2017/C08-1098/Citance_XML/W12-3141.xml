			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">This paper describes LIMSI’s submissions to the shared translation task of the Seventh Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">LIMSI participated in the French-English and GermanEnglish tasks in both directions.</S>

			<S sid ="21" ssid = "2">In this framework, translation is divided in two steps: a source reordering step and a (monotonic) translation step.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "3">Source reordering is based on a set of learned rewrite rules that non-deterministically reorder the input words.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "4">Applying these rules result in a finite-state graph of possible source reorderings, which is then searched for the best possible candidate translation.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "5">2.1 Features.</S>

			<S sid ="27" ssid = "8">Among the feature functions, the peculiar form of the translation model constitute one of the main difference between the n-gram approach and standard phrase-based systems.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "9">This will be further detailled in section 2.2 and 3.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "10">In addition to the translation model, fourteen feature functions are combined: a target-language model (Section 5.3); four lexicon models; six lexicalized reordering models (Tillmann, 2004; Crego et al., 2011) aiming at predicting the orientation of the next translation unit; a “weak” distance-based distortion model; and finally a word-bonus model and a tuple-bonus model which compensate for the system preference for short translations.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "11">The four lexicon models are similar to the ones used in standard phrase-based systems: two scores correspond to the relative frequencies of the tuples and two lexical weights are estimated from the automatic word alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "12">The weights vector λ is learned using a discriminative training framework (Och, 2003) (Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT)) using the newstest2009 as development set and BLEU (Pap- ineni et al., 2002) as the optimization criteria.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "13">2.2 Standard n-gram translation models.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "14">n-gram translation models rely on a specific decomposition of the joint probability of a sentence pair P (s, t): a sentence pair is assumed to be decomposed into a sequence of L bilingual units called tuples defining a joint segmentation: (s, t) = u1, ..., uL2.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "15">In the approach of (Marin˜ o et al., 2006), this segmentation is a byproduct of source reordering obtained by “unfolding” initial word alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "16">In this framework, the basic translation units are tuples, which are the analogous of phrase pairs and represent a matching u = (s, t) between a source s and a target t phrase (see Figure 1).</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "17">Using the n-gram assumption, the joint probability of a seg During the training phase (Marin˜ o et al., 2006), tuples are extracted from a word-aligned corpus (using MGIZA++3 with default settings) in such a way that a unique segmentation of the bilingual corpus is achieved.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "18">A baseline n-gram translation model is then estimated over a training corpus composed of tuple sequences using modified KnesserNey Smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "19">2.3 Inference.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "20">During decoding, source sentences are represented in the form of word lattices containing the most promising reordering hypotheses, so as to reproduce the word order modifications introduced during the tuple extraction process.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "21">Hence, only those reordering hypotheses are translated and they are introduced using a set of reordering rules automatically learned from the word alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "22">In the example in Figure 1, the rule [prix no- bel de la paix ❀ nobel de la paix prix] repro duces the invertion of the French words that is observed when translating from French into English.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "23">Typically, part-of-speech (POS) information is used to increase the generalization power of these rules.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "24">Hence, rewrite rules are built using POS rather than surface word forms (Crego and Marin˜ o, 2006).</S>

			<S sid ="44" ssid = "1">A first issue with the model described by equation (2) is that the elementary units are bilingual pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "2">As a consequence, the underlying vocabulary, hence the number of parameters, can be quite large, even for small translation tasks.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "3">Due to data sparsity issues, such model are bound to face severe estimation problems.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "4">Another problem with (2) is that the source and target sides play symmetric roles: yet, in decoding, the source side is known and only the target side must be predicted.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "5">3.1 A word factored translation model To overcome these issues, the n-gram probability in equation (2) can be factored by decomposing tuples 2 From now on, (s, t) thus denotes an aligned sentence pair,.</S>

			<S sid ="54" ssid = "11">The original (org) French sentence appears at the top of the figure, just above the reordered source s and target t. The pair (s, t) decomposes into a sequence of L bilingual units (tuples) u1 , ..., uL . Each tuple ui contains a source and a target phrase: si and ti . in two parts (source and target), and by taking words as the basic units of the n-gram TM.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "12">This may seem to be a regression with respect to current state-of- the-art SMT systems, as the shift from the word- based model of (Brown et al., 1993) to the phrase- based models of (Zens et al., 2002) is usually considered as a major breakthrough of the recent years.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "13">Indeed, one important motivation for considering phrases was to capture local context in translation and reordering.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "14">It should however be emphasized that the decomposition of phrases into words is only re-introduced here as a way to mitigate the parameter estimation problems.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "15">Translation units are still pairs of phrases, derived from a bilingual segmentation in tuples synchronizing the source and target n-gram streams.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "16">In fact, the estimation policy described in section 4 will actually allow us to take into account larger contexts than is possible with conventional n-gram models.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "17">pair using two sliding windows of length n, one for each language; however, the moves of these windows remain synchronized by the tuple segmentation.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "18">Moreover, the context is not limited to the current phrase, and continues to include words from adjacent phrases.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "19">Using the example of Figure 1, the contribution of the target phrase t11 = nobel, peace to P (s, t) using a 3- gram model is: P nobel|[receive, the], [la, paix]) ×P peace|[the, nobel], [la, paix]).</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "20">A benefit of this new formulation is that the vocabularies involved only contain words, and are thus much smaller that tuple vocabularies.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "21">These models are thus less at risk to be plagued by data sparsity issues.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "22">Moreover, the decomposition (3) now involves two models: the first term represents a TM, the second term is best viewed as a reordering model.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "23">In Let sk denote the kth word of source tuple si.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "24">this formulati on, the TM only predicts the target Considering the example of Figure 1, s1 denotes phrase, given its source and target contexts.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "25">the source word nobel, s4 the source word paix.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "26">We finally denote hn−1(tk ) the sequence made of the n − 1 words preceding tk in the target sentence: in Figure 1, h3(t2 ) thus refers to the three words P (s, t) = L |si | P si |h (si ), h (ti+1)) i k n−1 k 11 n−1 1 context receive the nobel associated with t2 peace.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "27">i=1 k=1 Using these notations, equation (2) is rewritten as: |ti | × P tk |hn−1(s1), hn−1(tk ))l (4) L P (a, s, t) = |ti | P tk |hn−1(tk ), hn−1(s1 )) i i i k=1 i=1 |si | i i k=1 i+1 (3)</S>

			<S sid ="71" ssid = "1">principles of SOUL In section 3.1, we defined a n gram translation × P sk |hn−1(t1), hn−1(sk ))l i i i k=1 This decomposition relies on the n-gram assumption, this time at the word level.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "2">Therefore, this model estimates the joint probability of a sentence model based on equations (3) and (4).</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "3">A major difficulty with such models is to reliably estimate their parameters, the numbers of which grow exponentially with the order of the model.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "4">This problem is aggravated in natural language processing due to the well-known data sparsity issue.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "5">In this work, we take advantage of the recent proposal of (Le et al., 2011).</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "6">Using a specific neural network architecture (the Structured OUtput Layer or SOUL model), it becomes possible to handle large vocabulary language modeling tasks.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "7">This approach was experimented last year for target language models only and is now extended to translation models.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "8">More details about the SOUL architecture can be found in (Le et al., 2011), while its extension to translation models is more precisely described in (Hai-Son et al., 2012).</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "9">The integration of SOUL models for large SMT tasks is carried out using a two-pass approach: the first pass uses conventional back-off n-gram translation and language models to produce a k-best list (the k most likely translations); in the second pass, the probability of a m-gram SOUL model is computed for each hypothesis and the k-best list is accordingly reordered.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "10">In all the following experiments, we used a context size for SOUL of m = 10, and used k = 300.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "11">The two decompositions of equations (3) and (4) are used by introducing 4 scores during the rescoring step.</S>

	<SECTION title="Corpora and data pre-processing. " number = "5">
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "1">Concerning data pre-processing, we started from our submissions from last year (Allauzen et al., 2011) and mainly upgraded the corpora and the associated language-dependent pre-processing routines.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "2">5.1 Pre-processing.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "3">We used in-house text processing tools for the to- kenization and detokenization steps (De´chelotte et al., 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "4">Previous experiments have demonstrated that better normalization tools provide better BLEU scores: all systems are thus built in “true-case”.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "5">Compared to last year, the pre-processing of utf8 characters was significantly improved.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "6">As German is morphologically more complex than English, the default policy which consists in treating each word form independently is plagued with data sparsity, which severely impacts both training (alignment) and decoding (due to unknown forms).</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "7">When translating from German into English, the German side is thus normalized using a specific pre-processing scheme (described in (Allauzen et al., 2010; Durgar ElKahlout and Yvon, 2010)), which aims at reducing the lexical redundancy by (i) normalizing the orthography, (ii) neutralizing most inflections and (iii) splitting complex compounds.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "8">All parallel corpora were POS-tagged with the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994); in addition, for German, fine-grained POS labels were also needed for pre-processing and were obtained using the RFTagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "9">5.2 Bilingual corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "10">As for last year’s evaluation, we used all the available parallel data for the GermanEnglish language pair, while only a subpart of the French-English parallel data was selected.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "11">Word alignment models were trained using all the data, whereas the translation models were estimated on a subpart of the parallel data: the UN corpus was discarded for this step and about half of the French-English Giga corpus was filtered based on a perplexity criterion as in (Allauzen et al., 2011)).</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "12">For French-English, we mainly upgraded the training material from last year by extracting the new parts from the common data.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "13">The word alignment models trained last year were then updated by running a forced alignment 4 of the new data.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "14">These new word-aligned data was added to last year’s parallel corpus and constitute the training material for the translation models and feature functions described in Section 2.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "15">Given the large amount of available data, three different bilingual n-gram models are estimated, one for each source of data: News-Commentary, Europarl, and the French- English Giga corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "16">These models are then added to the weighted mixture defined by equation (1).</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "17">For GermanEnglish, we simply used all the available parallel data to train one single translation models.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "18">5.3 Monolingual corpora and language models.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "19">For the monolingual training data, we also used the same setup as last year.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "20">For German, all the training data allowed in the constrained task were divided into several sets based on dates or genres: News-Commentary, the news crawled from the Web grouped by year, and Europarl.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "21">For each subset, a standard 4-gram LM was estimated using interpolated KneserNey smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 4 The forced alignment step consists in an additional EM iteration.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "22">1995; Chen and Goodman, 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "23">The resulting LMs are then linearly combined using interpolation coefficients chosen so as to minimize the perplexity of the development set.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "24">The German vocabulary is created using all the words contained in the parallel data and expanded to reach a total of 500k words by including the most frequent words observed in the monolingual News data for 2011.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "25">For French and English, the same monolingual corpora as last year were used5.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "26">We did not observe any perplexity decrease in our attempts to include the new data specifically provided for this year’s evaluation.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "27">We therefore used the same language models as in (Allauzen et al., 2011).</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "28">6 “On-the-fly” system We also developped an alternative approach implementing “on-the-fly” estimation of the parameter of a standard phase-based model, using Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) as the decoder.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "29">Implementing on-the- fly estimation for n-code, while possible in theory, is less appealing due to the computational cost of estimating a smoothed language model.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "30">Given an input source file, it is possible to compute only those statistics which are required to translate the phrases it contains.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "31">As in previous works on on- the-fly model estimation for SMT (CallisonBurch et al., 2005; Lopez, 2008), we compute a suffix array for the source corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "32">This further enables to consider only a subset of translation examples, which we select by deterministic random sampling, meaning that the sample is chosen randomly with respect to the full corpus but that the same sample is always returned for a given value of sample size, hereafter denoted N . In our experiments, we used N = 1, 000 and computed from the sample and the word alignments (we used the same tokenization and word alignments as in all other submitted systems) the same translation6 and lexical reordering models as the standard training scripts of the Moses system.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "33">Experiments were run on the data sets used for WMT English-French machine translation evaluation tasks, using the same corpora and optimization 5 The fifth edition of the English Gigaword (LDC2011T07).</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "34">was not used.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "35">procedure as in our other experiments.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "36">The only notable difference is our use of the Moses decoder instead of the n-gram-based system.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "37">As shown in Table 1, our on-the-fly system achieves a result (31.7 BLEU point) that is slightly worst than the n-code baseline (32.0) and slightly better than the equivalent Moses baseline (31.5), but does it much faster.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "38">Model estimation for the test file is reduced to 2 hours and 50 minutes, with an additional overhead for loading and writing files of one and a half hours, compared to roughly 210 hours for our baseline systems under comparable hardware conditions.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "39">7 Experimental results.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "40">7.1 n-code with SOUL Table 1 summarizes the experimental results submitted to the shared translation for French-English and GermanEnglish in both directions.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "41">The performances are measured in terms of BLEU on new- stest2011, last year’s test set, and this year’s test set newstest2012.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "42">For the former, BLEU scores are computed with the NIST script mtevav13.pl, while we provide for newstest2012 the results computed by the organizers 7.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "43">The Baseline results are obtained with standard n-gram models estimated with back-off, both for the bilingual and monolingual target models.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "44">With standard n-gram estimates, the order is limited to n = 4.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "45">For instance, the n-code French-English baseline achieves a 0.5 BLEU point improvement over a Moses system trained with the same data setup in both directions.</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "46">From Table 1, it can be observed that adding the SOUL models (translation models and target language model) consistently improves the baseline, with an increase of 1 BLEU point.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "47">Con- trastive experiments show that the SOUL target LM does not bring significant gain when added to the SOUL translation models.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "48">For instance, a gain of 0.3 BLEU point is observed when translating from.</S>
			<S sid ="130" ssid = "49">French to English with the addition of the SOUL target LM.</S>
			<S sid ="131" ssid = "50">In the other translation directions, the differences are negligible.</S>
			<S sid ="132" ssid = "51">7 All results come from the official website: http://.</S>
			<S sid ="133" ssid = "52">small gains on a smaller dataset (IWSLT’11), we did not observe here any improvement over the baseline system.</S>
			<S sid ="134" ssid = "53">Additional analysis hints that (i) most of the proposed variants are already covered by the translation model with high probabilities and (ii) that these variants are seldom found in the reference sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="135" ssid = "54">This means that, in the situation in which only one reference is provided, the hypotheses with a high score for the WSD feature are not adequately rewarded with the actual references.</S>

			<S sid ="137" ssid = "56">For newstest2012, the scores are provided by the organizers.</S>
			<S sid ="138" ssid = "57">7.2 Experiments with additional features.</S>
			<S sid ="139" ssid = "58">For this year’s evaluation, we also investigated several additional features based on IBM1 models and word sense disambiguation (WSD) information in rescoring.</S>
			<S sid ="140" ssid = "59">As for the SOUL models, these features are added after the n-best list generation step.</S>
			<S sid ="141" ssid = "60">In previous work (Och et al., 2004; Hasan, 2011), the IBM1 features (Brown et al., 1993) are found helpful.</S>
			<S sid ="142" ssid = "61">As the IBM1 model is asymmetric, two models are estimated, one in both directions.</S>
			<S sid ="143" ssid = "62">Contrary to the reported results, these additional features do not yield significant improvements over the baseline system.</S>
			<S sid ="144" ssid = "63">We assume that the difficulty is to add information to an already extensively optimized system.</S>
			<S sid ="145" ssid = "64">Moreover, the IBM1 models are estimated on the same training corpora as the translation system, a fact that may explain the redundancy of these additional features.</S>
			<S sid ="146" ssid = "65">In a separate series of experiments, we also add WSD features calculated according to a variation of the method proposed in (Apidianaki, 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="147" ssid = "66">For each word of a subset of the input (source language) vocabulary, a simple WSD classifier produces a probability distribution over a set of translations8.</S>
			<S sid ="148" ssid = "67">During reranking, each translation hypothesis is scanned and the word translations that match one of the proposed variant are rewarded using an additional score.</S>
			<S sid ="149" ssid = "68">While this method had given some 8 The difference with the method described in (Apidianaki,.</S>
			<S sid ="150" ssid = "69">2009) is that no sense clustering is performed, and each translation is represented by a separate weighted source feature vector which is used for disambiguation 8 Conclusion.</S>
			<S sid ="151" ssid = "70">In this paper, we described our submissions to WMT’12 in the French-English and GermanEnglish shared translation tasks, in both directions.</S>
			<S sid ="152" ssid = "71">As for our last year’s participation, our main systems are built with n-code, the open source Statistical Machine Translation system based on bilingual n-grams.</S>
			<S sid ="153" ssid = "72">Our contributions are threefold.</S>
			<S sid ="154" ssid = "73">First, we have experimented a new kind of translation models, where the bilingual n-gram distribution are estimated in a continuous space with neural networks.</S>
			<S sid ="155" ssid = "74">As shown in past evaluations with target language model, there is a significant reward for using this kind of models in a rescoring step.</S>
			<S sid ="156" ssid = "75">We observed that, in general, the continuous space translation model yields a slightly larger improvement than the target translation model.</S>
			<S sid ="157" ssid = "76">However, their combination does not result in an additional gain.</S>
			<S sid ="158" ssid = "77">We also reported preliminary results with a system ”on-the-fly”, where the training data are sampled according to the data to be translated in order to train contextually adapted system.</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "78">While this system achieves comparable performance to our baseline system, it is worth noticing that its total training time is much smaller than a comparable Moses system.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "79">Finally, we investigated several additional features based on IBM1 models and word sense disambiguation information in rescoring.</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "80">While these methods have sometimes been reported to help improve the results, we did not observe any improvement here over the baseline system.</S>
