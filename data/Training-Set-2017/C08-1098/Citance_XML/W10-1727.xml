			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">We present the Liu translation system for the constrained condition of the WMT10 shared translation task, between German and English in both directions.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">The system is based on the 2009 Liu submission (Holmqvist et al., 2009), that used compound processing, morphological sequence models, and improved alignment by reordering.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">This year we have focused on two issues: translation of verbs, which is problematic for translation between English and German since the verb placement is different with German verbs often being placed at the end of sentences; and OOVs, out- of-vocabulary words, which are problematic for machine translation in general.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Verb translation is targeted by trying to improve alignment, which we believe is a crucial step for verb translation since verbs that are far apart are often not aligned at all.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">We do this mainly by moving verbs to the end of sentences previous to alignment, which we also combine with other alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">We transform OOVs into known words in a post-processing step, based on casing, stemming, and splitting of hyphenated compounds.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">In addition, we perform general compound splitting for German both before training and translation, which also reduces the OOV rate.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">All results in this article are for the development test set newstest2009, on truecased output.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">We report Bleu scores (Papineni et al., 2002) and Meteor ranking (without WordNet) scores (Agar- wal and Lavie, 2008), using percent notation.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">We also used other metrics, but as they gave similar results they are not reported.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">For significance testing we used approximate randomization (Riezler and Maxwell, 2005), with p &lt; 0.05.</S>

	<SECTION title="Baseline System. " number = "2">
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "1">The 2010 Liu system is based on the PBSMT baseline system for the WMT shared translation task1.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "2">We use the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) for decoding and to train translation models, Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) for word alignment, and the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to train language models.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "3">The main difference to the WMT baseline is that the Liu system is trained on truecased data, as in Koehn et al.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "4">(2008), instead of lower- cased data.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "5">This means that there is no need for a full recasing step after translation, instead we only need to uppercase the first word in each sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "6">2.1 Corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "7">We participated in the constrained task, where we only trained the Liu system on the news and Europarl corpora provided for the workshop.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "8">The translation and reordering models were trained using the bilingual Europarl and news commentary corpora, which we concatenated.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "9">We used two sets of language models, one where we first trained two models on Europarl and news commentary, which we then interpolated 1 http://www.statmt.org/wmt10/baseline.</S>

			<S sid ="27" ssid = "11">Qc 2010 Association for Computational Linguistics with more weight given to the news commentary, using weights from Koehn and Schroeder (2007).</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "12">The second set of language models were trained on monolingual news data.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "13">For tuning we used every second sentence, in total 1025 sentences, of news-test2008.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "14">2.2 Training with Limited Computational.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "15">Resources One challenge for us was to train the translation sytem with limited computational resources.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "16">We trained all systems on one Intel Core 2 CPU, 3.0Ghz, 16 Gb of RAM, 64 bit Linux (RedHat) machine.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "17">This constrained the possibilities of using the data provided by the workshop to the full.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "18">The main problem was training the language models, since the monolingual data was very large compared to the bilingual data.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "19">In order to train language models that were both fast at runtime, and possible to train with the available memory, we chose to use the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002), with entropy-based pruning, with 10−8 as a threshold.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "20">To reduce the model size we also used lower order models for the large corpus; 4-grams instead of 5-grams for words and 6-grams instead of 7-grams for the morphological models.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "21">It was still impossible to train on the monolingual English news corpus, with nearly 50 million sentences, so we split that corpus into three equal size parts, and trained three models, that were interpolated with equal weights.</S>

	<SECTION title="Morphological Processing. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "1">We added morphological processing to the baseline system, by training additional sequence models on morphologically enriched part-of-speech tags, and by compound processing for German.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "2">We utilized the factored translation framework in Moses, to enrich the baseline system with an additional target sequence model.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "3">For English we used part-of-speech tags obtained using Tree- Tagger (Schmid, 1994), enriched with more fine- grained tags for the number of determiners, in order to target more agreement issues, since nouns already have number in the tagset.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "4">For German we used morphologically rich tags from RFTagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008), that contains morphological information such as case, number, and gender for nouns and tense for verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "5">We used the extra factor in an additional sequence model on the target side, which can improve word order System Bleu Meteor Baseline 13.42 48.83 + morph 13.85 49.69 + comp 14.24 49.41 Table 1: Results for morphological processing, English→German System Bleu Meteor Baseline 18.34 38.13 + morph 18.39 37.86 + comp 18.50 38.47 Table 2: Results for morphological processing, German→English and agreement between words.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "6">For German the factor was also used for compound merging.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "7">Prior to training and translation, compound processing was performed, using an empirical method (Koehn and Knight, 2003; Stymne, 2008) that splits words if they can be split into parts that occur in a monolingual corpus, choosing the splitting option with the highest arithmetic mean of its part frequencies in the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "8">We split nouns, adjectives and verbs, into parts that are content words or particles.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "9">We imposed a length limit on parts of 3 characters for translation from German and of 6 characters for translation from English, and we had a stop list of parts that often led to errors, such as arische (Aryan) in konsularische (consular).</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "10">We allowed 10 common letter changes (Langer, 1998) and hyphens at split points.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "11">Compound parts were given a special part-of-speech tag that matches the head word.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "12">For translation into German, compound parts were merged into full compounds using a method described in Stymne and Holmqvist (2008), which is based on matching of the special part-of-speech tag for compound parts.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "13">A word with a compound POS-tag were merged with the next word, if their POS-tags were matching.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "14">Tables 1 and 2 show the results of the additional morphological processing.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "15">Adding the sequence models on morphologically enriched part- of-speech tags gave a significant improvement for translation into German, but similar or worse results as the baseline for translation into English.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "16">This is not surprising, since German morphology is more complex than English morphology.</S>

	<SECTION title="Improved Alignment by Reordering. " number = "4">
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "1">Previous work has shown that translation quality can be improved by making the source language more similar to the target language, for instance in terms of word order (Wang et al., 2007; Xia and McCord, 2004).</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "2">In order to harmonize the word order of the source and target sentence, they applied handcrafted or automatically induced reordering rules to the source sentences of the training corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "3">At decoding time, reordering rules were again applied to input sentences before translation.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "4">The positive effects of such methods seem to come from a combination of improved alignment and improved reordering during translation.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "5">In contrast, we focus on improving the word alignment by reordering the training corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "6">The training corpus is reordered prior to word alignment with Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and then the word links are readjusted back to the original word positions.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "7">From the readjusted corpus, we create phrase tables that allow translation of non- reordered input text.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "8">Consequently, our reordering only affects the word alignment and the phrase tables extracted from it.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "9">We investigated two ways of reordering.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "10">The first method is based on word alignments and the other method is based on moving verbs to similar positions in the source and target sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "11">We also investigated different combinations of reorderings and alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "12">All results for the systems with improved reordering are shown in Tables 3 and 4.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "13">4.1 Reordering Based on Alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "14">The first reordering method does not require any syntactic information or rules for reordering.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "15">We simply used symmetrized Giza++ word alignments to reorder the words in the source sentences to reflect the target word order and applied Giza++ Table 3: Results for improved alignment, base+verb 18.66 38.61 base+verb+reorder 18.73 38.59 Table 4: Results for improved alignment, German→English again to the reordered training corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "16">The following steps were performed to produce the final word alignment: 1.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "17">Word align the training corpus with Giza++..</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "18">2.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "19">Reorder the source words according to the or-.</S>

			<S sid ="76" ssid = "21">3.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "22">Word align the reordered source and original.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "23">target corpus with Giza++.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "24">4.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "25">Readjust the new word alignments so that.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "26">they align source and target words in the original corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "27">The system built on this word alignment (reorder) had a significant improvement in Bleu score over the unreordered baseline (base) for translation into English, and small improvements otherwise.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "28">4.2 Verb movement.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "29">The positions of finite verbs are often very different in English and German, where they are often placed at the end of sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "30">In several cases we noted that finite verbs were misaligned by Giza++.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "31">To improve the alignment of verbs, we moved all verbs in both English and German to the end of the sentences prior to word alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "32">The reordered sentences were word aligned with Giza++ and the res ulti ng wor d link s wer e the n re adj ust ed to ali gn Ty pe G er m an E n gli sh wor ds in the orig inal cor pu s. tot al O O Vs 1 8 3 3 1 4 8 9 T h e s y s t e m c r e a t e d f r o m t h i s a li g n m e n t ( v e r b ) ca si ng 1 2 4 2 6 res ulte d in sig nifi can tly low er sco res tha n bas e for st e m mi ng 2 7 0 7 2 tran slati on into Ger ma n, and simi lar scor es as bas e hy ph en at ed w or ds 2 3 0 1 2 4 for translation into English.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "33">4.3 Combination Systems.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "34">The alignment based on reordered verbs did not produce a better alignment in terms of Bleu scores of the resulting translations, which led us to the conclusion that the alignment was noisy.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "35">However, it is possible that we did correctly align some words that were misaligned in the baseline alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "36">To investigate this issue we concatenated first the baseline and verb alignments, and then all three alignments, and extracted phrase tables from the concatenated training sets.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "37">All scores for both combined systems significantly outperformed the unfactored baseline, and were slightly better than base.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "38">For translation into German it was best to use the combination of only verb and base, which was significantly better than base on Meteor.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "39">This shows that even though the verb alignments were not good when used in a single system, they still could contribute in a combination system.</S>

	<SECTION title="Preprocessing of OOVs. " number = "5">
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "1">Out-of-vocabulary words, words that have not been seen in the training data, are a problem in statistical machine translation, since no translations have been observed for them.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "2">The standard strategy is to transfer them as is to the translation output, which, naive as it sounds, actually works well in some cases, since many OOVs are numbers or proper names (Stymne and Holmqvist, 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "3">However, it still results in incomprehensible words in the output in many cases.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "4">We have investigated several ways of changing unknown words into similar words that have been seen in the training data, in a preprocessing step.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "5">We also considered another OOV problem, number formatting, since it differs between English and German.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "6">To address this, we swapped decimal points/commas, and other delimeters for unknown numbers in a post-processing step.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "7">In the preprocessing step, we applied a number of transformations to each OOV word, accepting the first applicable transformation that led to a known word: end hyphens 24 – Table 5: Number of affected words by OOVpreprocessing 1.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "8">Change the word into a known cased ver-.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "9">sion (since we trained a truecased system, this handles cased variations of words) 2.</S>

			<S sid ="105" ssid = "11">choose the most common realisation of that stem (using a Porter stemmer) 3.</S>

			<S sid ="107" ssid = "13">any of the resulting parts are OOVs, they are recursively treated as well) 4.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "14">Remove hyphens at the end of German words.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "15">(that could result from compound splitting) The first two steps were based on frequency lists of truecased and stemmed words that we compiled from the monolingual training corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "16">Inspection of the initial results showed that proper names were often changed into other words in English, so we excluded them from the preprocessing by not applying it to words with an initial capital letter.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "17">This happened to a lesser extent for German, but here it was impossible to use the same simple heuristic for proper names, since German nouns also have an initial capital letter.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "18">The number of affected words for the baseline using the final transformations are shown in Table 5.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "19">Even though we managed to transform some.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "20">words, we still lack a transformation for the majority of OOVs.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "21">Despite this, there is a tendency of small improvements on both metrics in the majority of cases in both translation directions, as shown in Tables 6 and 7.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "22">Figure 1 shows an example of how OOV processing affects one sentence for translation from German to English.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "23">In this case splitting a hyphenated compound gives a better translation, even though the word opening is chosen rather than jack.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "24">There is also a stemming change, where the adjective ausgereiftesten (the most well- engineered), is changed form superlative to positive.</S>
