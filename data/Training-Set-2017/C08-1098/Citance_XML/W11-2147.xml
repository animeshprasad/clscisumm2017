			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">In this paper we present the LIU system for the WMT11 shared task, for translation between English and German in both directions.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">We added a number of features that address problems for translation between German and English such as word order differences, incorrect alignment of certain words such as verbs, and the morphological complexity of German compared to English, as well as dealing with previously unseen words.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">In both translation directions our systems include compound processing, morphological sequence models, and a hierarchical reordering model.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">For German–English translation we also added morphological normalization, source side reordering, and processing of out-of-vocabulary words (OOVs).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">For English–German translation, we extracted word alignments with a supervised method and combined these alignments with Giza++ alignments in various ways to improve the phrase table.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">We experimented with different ways of combining the two alignments such as using heuristic symmetrization and interpolating phrase tables.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Results are reported on three metrics, BLEU (Pa- pineni et al., 2002), NIST (Doddington, 2002) and Meteor ranking scores (Agarwal and Lavie, 2008) based on truecased output.</S>

	<SECTION title="Baseline System. " number = "2">
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "1">This years improvements were added to the LIU baseline system (Stymne et al., 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "2">Our baseline is a factored phrase based SMT system that uses the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) for translation model training and decoding, GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) for word alignment, SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) an KenLM (Heafield, 2011) for language modelling and minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) to tune model feature weights.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "3">In addition, the LIU baseline contains: • Compound processing, including compound splitting and for translation into German also compound merging • Part-of-speech and morphological sequence models All models were trained on truecased data.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "4">Translation and reordering models were trained using the bilingual Europarl and News Commentary corpora that were concatenated before training.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "5">We created two language models.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "6">The first model is a 5-gram model that we created by interpolating two language 393 Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 393–398, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, July 30–31, 2011.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "7">Qc 2011 Association for Computational Linguistics models from bilingual News Commentary and Europarl with more weight on the News Commentary model.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "8">The second model is a 4-gram model trained on monolingual News only.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "9">All models were created using entropy-based pruning with 10−8 as the threshold.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "10">Due to time constraints, all tuning and evaluation were performed on half of the provided shared task data.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "11">Systems were tuned on 1262 sentences from newstest2009 and all results reported in Tables 1 and 2 are based on a devtest set of 1244 sentences from newstest2010.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "12">2.1 Sequence models with part-of-speech and.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "13">morphology To improve target word order and agreement in the translation output, we added an extra output factor in our translation models consisting of tags with POS and morphological features.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "14">For English we used tags that were obtained by enriching POS tags from TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) with additional morphological features such as number for determiners.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "15">For German, the POS and morphological tags were obtained from RFTagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008) which provides morphological information such as case, number and gender for nouns and tense for verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "16">We trained two sequence models for each system over this output factor and added them as features in our baseline system.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "17">The first sequence model is a 7-gram model interpolated from models of bilingual Europarl and News Commentary.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "18">The second model is a 6-gram model trained on monolingual News only.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "19">2.2 Compound processing.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "20">In both translation directions we split compounds, using a modified version of the corpus-based splitting method of Koehn and Knight (2003).</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "21">We split nouns, verb, and adjective compounds into known parts that were content words or cardinal numbers, based on the arithmetic mean of the frequency of the parts in the training corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "22">We allowed 10 common letter changes (Langer, 1998) and hyphens at split points.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "23">Compound parts were kept in their surface form and compound modifiers received a part- of-speech tag based on that of the tag of the full compound.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "24">For translation into German, compounds were merged using the POS-merging strategy of Stymne (2009).</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "25">A compound part in the translation output, identified by the special part-of-speech tags, was merged with the next word if that word had a matching part-of-speech tag.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "26">If the compound part was followed by the conjunction und (and), we added a hyphen to the part, to account for coordinated compounds.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "27">2.3 Hierarchical reordering.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "28">In our baseline system we experimented with two lexicalized reordering models.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "29">The standard model in Moses (Koehn et al., 2005), and the hierarchical model of Galley and Manning (2008).</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "30">In both models the placement of a phrase is compared to that of the previous and/or next phrase.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "31">In the standard model up to three reorderings are distinguished, monotone, swap, and discontinuous.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "32">In the hierarchical model the discontinuous class can be further subdivided into two classes, left and right discontinuous.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "33">The hierarchical model further differs from the standard model in that it compares the order of the phrase with the next or previous block of phrases, not only with the next or previous single phrase.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "34">We investigated one configuration of each model.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "35">For the standard model we used the msd- bidirectional-fe setting, which uses three orientations, is conditioned on both the source and target language, and considers both the previous and next phrase.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "36">For the hierarchical model we used all four orientations, and again it is conditioned on both the source and target language, and considers both the previous and next phrase.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "37">The result of replacing the standard reordering model with an hierarchical model is shown in Table 1 and 2.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "38">For translation into German adding the hierarchical model led to small improvements as measured by NIST and Meteor.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "39">For translation in the other direction, the differences on automatic metrics were very small.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "40">Still, we decided to use the hierarchical model in all our systems.</S>

			<S sid ="69" ssid = "18">This strategy is sim ilar to that of ElKahlout and Yvon (2010), but we used a slightly different set of transformations, that we thought better mirrored the English structure.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "19">For morphological tags we used RFTagger and for lemmas we used TreeTagger.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "20">The morphological transformations we performed were the following: • Nouns: – Replace with lemma+s if plural number – Replace with lemma otherwise • Verbs: – Replace with lemma if present tense, not third person singular – Replace with lemma+p if past tense • Adjectives: – Replace with lemma+c if comparative – Replace with lemma+sup if superlative – Replace with lemma otherwise • Articles: – Definite articles: ∗ Replace with des if genitive ∗ Replace with der otherwise – Indefinite articles: ∗ Replace with eines if genitive ∗ Replace with ein otherwise • Pronouns: – Replace with RELPRO if relative – Replace with lemma if indefinite, interrogative, or possessive pronouns – Add +g to all pronouns which are genitive, unless they are possessive For all word types that are not mentioned in the list, surface forms were kept.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "21">Table 1: German–English translation results.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "22">Results are cumulative.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "23">We also performed those tokenization and spelling normalizations suggested by ElKahlout and Yvon (2010), that we judged could safely be done for translation from German without collecting corpus statistics.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "24">We split words with numbers and letters, such as 40ja¨ hrigen or 40ja¨ hrigen (40 year-old), unless the suffix indicates that it is a ordinal, such as 70sten (70th).</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "25">We also did some spelling normalization by exchanging ß with ss and replacing tripled consonants with doubled consonants.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "26">These changes would have been harmful for translation into German, since they change the language into a normalized variant, but for translation from German we considered them safe.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "27">3.2 Source side reordering.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "28">To make the word order of German input sentences more English-like a version of the rules of (Collins et al., 2005) were partially implemented using tagged output from the RFTagger.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "29">Basically, beginnings of subordinate clauses, their subjects (if present) and final verb clusters were identified based on tag sequences, and the clusters were moved to the beginning of the clause, and reordered so that the finite verb ended up in the second clause position.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "30">Also, some common adverbs were moved with the verb cluster and placed between finite and non- finite verbs.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "31">After testing, we decided to apply these rules only to subordinate clauses at the end of sentences, since these were the only ones that could be identified with good precision.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "32">Still, some 750,000 clauses were reordered.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "33">3.3 OOV Processing.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "34">We also added limited processing of OOVs.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "35">In a pre- processing step we replaced unknown words with known cased variants if available, removed markup from normalized words if that resulted in an un known token, and split hyphened words.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "36">We also split suspected names in cases where we had a pattern with a single uppercase letter in the middle of a word, such as ConocoPhillips into Conoco Phillips.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "37">In a post-processing step we changed the number formatting of unknown numbers by changing decimal points and thousand separators, to agree with English orthography.</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "38">This processing only affects a small number of words, and cannot be expected to make a large impact on the final results.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "39">Out of 884 OOVs in the devtest, 39 had known cased options, 126 hyphened words were split, 147 cases had markup from the normalization removed, and 13 suspected names were split.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "40">3.4 Results.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "41">The results of these experiments can be seen in Table 1 where each new addition is added to the previous system.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "42">When we compare the new additions with the baseline with hierarchical reordering, we see that while the normalization did not seem to have a positive effect on any metric, both source reordering and OOV processing led to small increases on all scores.</S>

			<S sid ="94" ssid = "1">For translation from English into German we attempted to improve the quality of the phrase table by adding new word alignments to the standard Giza++ alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "2">4.1 Phrase-based word alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "3">We experimented with different ways of combining word alignments from Giza++ with alignments created using phrase-based word alignment (PAL) which previously has been shown to improve alignment quality for English–Swedish (Holmqvist, 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "4">The idea of phrase-based word alignment is to use word and part-of-speech sequence patterns from manual word alignments to align new texts.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "5">First, parallel phrases containing a source segment, a target segment and links between source and target words are extracted from word aligned texts (Figure 1).</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "6">In the second step, these phrases are matched against new parallel text and if a matching phrase is found, word links from the phrase are added to the corresponding words in the new text.</S>

			<S sid ="112" ssid = "19">segments were replaced by POS/morphological tags from RFTagger.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "20">Alignment patterns were extracted from 1000 sentences in the manually word aligned sample of English–German Europarl texts from Pado and Lap- ata (2006).</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "21">All parallel phrases were extracted from the word aligned texts, as when extracting a translation model.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "22">Parallel phrases that contain at least 3 words were generalized with POS tags to form word/POS patterns for alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "23">A subset of these patterns, with high alignment precision (&gt; 0.80) on the 1000 sentences, were used to align the entire training corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "24">We combined the new word alignments with the Giza++ alignments in two ways.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "25">In the first method, we used a symmetrization heuristic similar to grow-diag-final-and to combine three word alignments into one, the phrase-based alignment and two Giza++ alignments in different directions.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "26">In the second method we extracted a separate phrase table from the sparser phrase-based alignment using a constrained method of phrase extraction that limited the number of unaligned words in each phrase pair.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "27">The reason for constraining the phrase table extraction was that the standard extraction method does not work well for the sparse word alignments that PAL produces, but we think it could still be useful for extracting highly reliable phrases.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "28">After some experimentation we decided to allow an unlimited number of internal unaligned words, that is un- aligned words that are surrounded by aligned words, but limit the number of external unaligned words, i.e., unaligned words at the beginning or end of the phrase, to either one each in the source and target phrase, or to zero.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "29">We used two ways to include the sparse phrase- table into the translation process: • Have two separate phrase-tables, the sparse table, and the standard GIZA++ based phrase- table, and use Moses’ dual decoding paths.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "30">• Interpolate the sparse phrase-table with the standard phrase-table, using the mixture model formulation of Ueffing et al.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "31">(2007), with equal weights, in order to boost the probabilities of highly reliable phrases.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "32">4.2 Results.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "33">We evaluated our systems on devtest data and found that the added phrase-based alignments did not produce large differences in translation quality compared to the baseline system with hierarchical reordering as shown in Table 2.</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "34">The system created with a heuristic combination of PAL and Giza++ (pal-gdfa) had a small increase in BLEU, but no improvement on the other metrics.</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "35">Systems using a phrase table extracted from the sparse alignments did not produce better results than baseline.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "36">The system using dual decoding paths (pal-dual) produced worse results than the system using an interpolated phrase table (pal-inter).</S>
