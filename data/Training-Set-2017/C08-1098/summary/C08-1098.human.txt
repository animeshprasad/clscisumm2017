In this paper, Schmid and Laws present a  RFTagger or Hidden-Markov-Model (HMM) part-of-speech tagger  using German and Czech corpora.HMM tagging decomposes the POS tags into a set of simple attributes, and uses decision tree to estimate the probability of each attribute. Decision tree assigns classes to objects which are represented as attribute vectors. Their tagger applies a beam-search strategy to increase the speed and uses dot to separate the attributes. It also applies pre-pruning citeria. Their tagger is fast and can be successfully applied to a wide range of languages and training corpora. Their tagger is highly accurate in comparison to TnTagger and SVMTool.
