			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a fundamental language analysis task.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">In POS tagging, we frequently encounter words that do not exist in training data.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Such words are called unknown words.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">They are usually handled by an exceptional process in POS tagging, because the tagging system does not have information about the words.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Guessing the POS tags of such unknown words is a difficult task.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">But it is an important issue both for conducting POS tagging accurately and for creating word dictionaries automatically or semi- automatically.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">There have been many studies on POS guessing of unknown words (Mori and Nagao, 1996; Mikheev, 1997; Chen et al., 1997; Nagata, 1999; Orphanos and Christodoulakis, 1999).</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">In most of these previous works, POS tags of unknown words were predicted using only local information, such as lexical forms and POS tags of surrounding words or word-internal features (e.g. suffixes and character types) of the unknown words.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">However, this approach has limitations in available information.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">For example, common nouns and proper nouns are sometimes difficult to distinguish with only the information of a single occurrence because their syntactic functions are almost identical.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">In English, proper nouns are capitalized and there is generally little ambiguity between common nouns and proper nouns.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">In Chinese and Japanese, no such convention exists and the problem of the ambiguity is serious.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">However, if an unknown word with the same lex ical form appears in another part with informative local features (e.g. titles of persons), this will give useful clues for guessing the part-of-speech of the ambiguous one, because unknown words with the same lexical form usually have the same part-of-speech.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">For another example, there is a part-of-speech named sahen-noun (verbal noun) in Japanese.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">Verbal nouns behave as common nouns, except that they are used as verbs when they are followed by a verb “suru”; e.g., a verbal noun “dokusho” means “reading” and “dokushosuru” is a verb meaning to “read books”.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">It is difficult to distinguish a verbal noun from a common noun if it is used as a noun.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">However, it will be easy if we know that the word is followed by “suru” in another part in the document.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">This issue was mentioned by Asahara (2003) as a problem of possibility-based POS tags.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">A possibility-based POS tag is a POS tag that represents all the possible properties of the word (e.g., a verbal noun is used as a noun or a verb), rather than a property of each instance of the word.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">For example, a sahen- noun is actually a noun that can be used as a verb when it is followed by “suru”.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">This property cannot be confirmed without observing real usage of the word appearing with “suru”.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">Such POS tags may not be identified with only local information of one instance, because the property that each instance has is only one among all the possible properties.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">To cope with these issues, we propose a method that uses global information as well as local information for guessing the parts-of-speech of unknown words.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">With this method, all the occurrences of the unknown words in a document1 are taken into consideration at once, rather than that each occurrence of the words is processed separately.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">Thus, the method models the whole document and finds a set of parts-of-speech by maximizing its conditional joint probability given the document, rather than independently maximizing the probability of each part-of-speech given each sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">Global information is known to be useful in other NLP tasks, especially in the named entity recognition task, and several studies successfully used global features (Chieu and Ng, 2002; Finkel et al., 2005).</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">One potential advantage of our method is its 1 In this paper, we use the word document to denote the whole data consisting of multiple sentences (training corpus or test corpus).</S>

			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">Qc 2006 Association for Computational Linguistics ability to incorporate unlabeled data.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">Global features can be increased by simply adding unlabeled data into the test data.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "35">Models in which the whole document is taken into consideration need a lot of computation compared to models with only local features.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "36">They also cannot process input data one-by-one.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "37">Instead, the entire document has to be read before processing.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "38">We adopt Gibbs sampling in order to compute the models efficiently, and these models are suitable for offline use such as creating dictionaries from raw text where real-time processing is not necessary but high-accuracy is needed to reduce human labor required for revising automatically analyzed data.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "39">The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes a method for POS guessing of unknown words which utilizes global information.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "40">Section 3 shows experimental results on multiple corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "41">Section 4 discusses related work, and Takamura et al.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "42">(2005) applied this model to an NLP task, semantic orientation extraction, and we apply it to POS guessing of unknown words here.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "43">Suppose that unknown words with the same lexical form appear K times in a document.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "44">Assume that the number of possible POS tags for unknown words is N , and they are represented by integers from 1 to N . Let tk denote the POS tag of the kth occurrence of the unknown words, let wk denote the local context (e.g. the lexical forms and the POS tags of the surrounding words) of the kth occurrence of the unknown words, and let w and t denote the sets of wk and tk respectively: w = {w1 , · · · , wK }, t = {t1 , · · · , tK }, tk ∈ {1, · · · , N }.</S>

			<S sid ="48" ssid = "2">We assume that POS tags of known words are already determined beforehand, and positions in the document where unknown words appear are also identified.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "3">Thus, we focus only on prediction of the POS tags of unknown words.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "4">In the rest of this section, we first present a model for POS guessing of unknown words with global information.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "5">Next, we show how the test data is analyzed and how the parameters of the model are estimated.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "6">A method for incorporating where p0(t|w) is an initial distribution (local model) of the part-of-speech t which is calculated with only the local context w, using arbitrary statistical models such as maximum entropy models.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "7">The right hand side of the above equation consists of two components; one represents global interactions between each pair of parts-of-speech, and the other represents the effects of local information.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "8">In this study, we fix the inverse temperature β = 1.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "9">The distribution of t is then obtained from Equation (1), (2) and (3) as follows: 1 1 K K unlabeled data with the model is also discussed.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "10">2.1 Probabilistic Model Using Global.</S>

			<S sid ="58" ssid = "12">We suppose that such parts of-speech have correlation, and the part-of-speech of each occurrence is also affected by its local context.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "13">Similar situations to this are handled in physics.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "14">For example, let us consider a case where a number of electrons with spins exist in a system.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "15">The spins interact with each other, and each spin is also affected by the external magnetic field.</S>

			<S sid ="63" ssid = "17">The above equations can be rewritten as follows by defining a function fi,j (t): physical model, if the state of the system is s and K K 1 the energy of the system is E(s), the probability distribution of s is known to be represented by the following Boltzmann distribution: fi,j (t)≡ δ(tk , i)δ(tkt , j), (7) 2 k=1 kt =1 kt j=k P (s)= 1 exp{−βE(s)}, (1) 1 Z P (t|w)= Z (w) p0 (t|w) exp N N λi,j fi,j (t) , (8) izing constant defined as follows: N N Z = exp{−βE(s)}.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "18">(2) s Z (w)= t∈T (w) p0 (t|w) exp λi,j fi,j (t) i=1 j=1 , (9) where δ(i, j) is the Kronecker delta: δ(i, j)=f 1 (i = j), 0 i = j initialize t(1) for m := 2 to M for k := 1 to K t(m) (m) (m) (m−1) (m−1) fi,j (t) represents the number of occurrences of the POS tag pair i and j in the whole document (divided by 2), and the model in Equation (8) is essentially a maximum entropy model with the document level features.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "19">As shown above, we consider the conditional k ∼ P (tk |w, t1 , · · · , tk−1 , tk+1 , · · · , tK ) Figure 1: Gibbs Sampling is a distribution of x, and {x(1), · · · , x(M )} are M samples generated from P (x).</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "20">Then, the expectation of A(x) over P (x) is approximated by the joint probability of all the occurrences of the unknown words with the same lexical form in the samples: 1 A(x)P (x)c: M A(x(m) ).</S>

			<S sid ="68" ssid = "22">Note that we assume independence between the unknown words with different lexical Thus, if we have M samples {t(1), · · · , t(M )} generated from the conditional joint distribution P (t|w), the marginal distribution of each POS tag is approximated as follows: M 1 forms, and each set of the unknown words with the same lexical form is processed separately from the Pk (t|w)c: M m=1 δ(t(m) , t).</S>

			<S sid ="70" ssid = "24">2.2 Decoding.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "25">Let us consider how to find the optimal POS tags t basing on the model, given K local contexts of the unknown words with the same lexical form (test data) w, an initial distribution p0(t|w) and a set of model parameters Λ = {λ1,1, · · · , λN,N }.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "26">One way to do this is to find a set of POS tags which maximizes P (t|w) among all possible candidates of t. However, the number of all possible candidates of the POS tags is N K and the calculation is generally intractable.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "27">Although HMMs, MEMMs, and CRFs use dynamic programming and some studies with probabilistic models which have specific structures use efficient algorithms (Wang et al., 2005), such methods cannot be applied here because we are considering interactions (dependencies) between all POS tags, and their joint dis Next, we describe how to generate samples from the distribution.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "28">We use Gibbs sampling for this purpose.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "29">Gibbs sampling is one of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which can generate samples efficiently from high- dimensional probability distributions (Andrieu et al., 2003).</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "30">The algorithm is shown in Figure 1.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "31">The algorithm firstly set the initial state t(1), then one new random variable is sampled at a time from the conditional distribution in which all other variables are fixed, and new samples are cre ated by repeating the process.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "32">Gibbs sampling is easy to implement and is guaranteed to converge to the true distribution.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "33">The conditional distribution P (tk |w, t1, · · · , tk−1, tk+1, · · · , tK ) in Figure 1 can be calculated simply as follows: P (tk |w, t1 , · · · , tk−1 , tk+1 , · · · , tK ) = P (t|w) , P (t1 , · · · , tk−1 , tk+1 , · · · , tK |w) Z(w) p0 (t|w) exp{ 2 t =1 ktt =1 λt ,t tribution cannot be decomposed.</S>

			<S sid ="128" ssid = "30">In order to estimate the global model parameters , we firstly train sub local models 1 and 2 from the sub training data 1 and 2 respectivel y (Figure 2, *3).</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "31">The sub local models 1 and 2 are used for calculating p0(t|w) of unknown words in the sub training data 2 and 1 re Data flow for training Data flow for testing Figure 2: Experimental Procedure data 1 but not in the sub-training data 2, or vice versa.</S>
			<S sid ="130" ssid = "32">We handle these words as (pseudo) unknown words in the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="131" ssid = "33">Such (twofold) cross-validation is necessary to make training examples that contain unknown words3.</S>
			<S sid ="132" ssid = "34">POS tags that these pseudo unknown words have are defined as open class tags, and only the open class tags are considered as candidate POS tags for unknown words in the test data (i.e., N is equal to the number of the open class tags).</S>
			<S sid ="133" ssid = "35">In the training phase, we need to estimate two types of parameters; local model (parameters), which is necessary to calculate p0(t|w), and global model (parameters), i.e., λi,j . The local model parameters are estimated using all the training data (Figure 2, *2).</S>
			<S sid ="134" ssid = "36">Local 3 A major method for generating such pseudo unknown words is to collect the words that appear only once in a corpus (Nagata, 1999).</S>
			<S sid ="135" ssid = "37">These words are called hapax legomena and known to have similar characteristics to real unknown words (Baayen and Sproat, 1996).</S>
			<S sid ="136" ssid = "38">These words are interpreted as being collected by the leave-one-out technique (which is a special case of cross-validation) as follows: One word is picked from the corpus and the rest of the corpus is considered as training data.</S>
			<S sid ="137" ssid = "39">The picked word is regarded as an unknown word if it does not exist in the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="138" ssid = "40">This procedure is iterated for all the words in the corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="139" ssid = "41">However, this approach is not applicable to our experiments because those words that appear only once in the corpus do spectively, when the global model parameters are estimated from the entire training data.</S>
			<S sid ="140" ssid = "42">In the testing phase, p0(t|w) of unknown words in the test data are calculated using the local model parameters which are estimated from the entire training data, and test results are obtained using the global model with the local model.</S>
			<S sid ="141" ssid = "43">Global information cannot be used for unknown words whose lexical forms appear only once in the training or test data, so we process only non- unique unknown words (unknown words whose lexical forms appear more than once) using the proposed model.</S>
			<S sid ="142" ssid = "44">In the testing phase, POS tags of unique unknown words are determined using only the local information, by choosing POS tags which maximize p0(t|w).</S>
			<S sid ="143" ssid = "45">Unlabeled data can be optionally used for semi- supervised learning.</S>
			<S sid ="144" ssid = "46">In that case, the test data and the unlabeled data are concatenated, and the best POS tags which maximize the probability of the mixed data are searched.</S>
			<S sid ="145" ssid = "47">3.2 Initial Distribution.</S>
			<S sid ="146" ssid = "48">In our method, the initial distribution p0(t|w) is used for calculating the probability of t given local context w (Equation (8)).</S>
			<S sid ="147" ssid = "49">We use maximum entropy (ME) models for the initial distribution.</S>
			<S sid ="148" ssid = "50">p0(t|w) is calculated by ME models as follows (Berger et al., 1996): H 1 not have global information and are useless for learning the global model, so we use the twofold cross validation method.</S>
