<S sid="0">Named Entity Recognition: A Maximum Entropy Approach Using Global Information</S>
<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">This paper presents a maximum entropy-based named entity recognizer (NER).</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">It differs from previous machine learning-based NERs in that it uses information from the whole document to classify each word, with just one classifier.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">Previous work that involves the gathering of information from the whole document often uses a secondary classifier, which corrects the mistakes of a primary sentence- based classifier.</S>
<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">In this paper, we show that the maximum entropy framework is able to make use of global information directly, and achieves performance that is comparable to the best previous machine learning-based NERs on MUC6 and MUC7 test data.</S>
