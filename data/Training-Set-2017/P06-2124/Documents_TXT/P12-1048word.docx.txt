Abstract

To adapt a  translation model trained from 
the data in one domain to another, previous 
works paid more attention to the studies of 
parallel corpus while ignoring the in-domain 
monolingual corpora which can be obtained 
more easily.   In  this paper, we propose a 
novel approach for translation model adapta- 
tion by utilizing in-domain monolingual top- 
ic information instead of the in-domain bilin- 
gual corpora, which incorporates the topic in- 
formation into translation probability estima- 
tion. Our method establishes the relationship 
between the out-of-domain bilingual corpus 
and the in-domain monolingual corpora vi- 
a topic mapping and phrase-topic distribution 
probability estimation from in-domain mono- 
lingual corpora.  Experimental result on the 
NIST Chinese-English translation task shows 
that our approach significantly outperforms 
the baseline system.


1   Introduction

In recent years, statistical machine translation(SMT) 
has been rapidly developing with more and more 
novel translation models being proposed and put in- 
to practice (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004; 
Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Chiang, 2007; 
Chiang, 2010).  However, similar to other natural 
language processing(NLP)  tasks, SMT systems of- 
ten suffer from domain adaptation problem during 
practical applications.  The simple reason is that the 
underlying statistical models always tend to closely

ship at Baidu.


approximate the empirical distributions of the train- 
ing data, which typically consist of bilingual sen- 
tences and monolingual  target language sentences. 
When the translated texts and the training data come 
from the same domain, SMT systems can achieve 
good performance, otherwise the translation quality 
degrades dramatically. Therefore, it is of significant 
importance to develop translation systems which can 
be effectively transferred from one domain to anoth- 
er, for example, from newswire to weblog.
  According to adaptation emphases, domain adap- 
tation in SMT can be classified into translation mod- 
el adaptation and language model adaptation. Here 
we focus on how to adapt a translation model, which 
is trained from the large-scale out-of-domain bilin- 
gual corpus, for domain-specific translation task, 
leaving others for future work. In this aspect, pre- 
vious methods can be divided into two categories: 
one paid attention to collecting  more sentence pairs 
by information retrieval technology (Hildebrand et 
al., 2005) or synthesized parallel  sentences (Ueffing 
et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2008; Bertoldi and Federico,
2009; Schwenk and Senellart, 2009), and the other 
exploited the full potential of existing parallel cor- 
pus in a mixture-modeling  (Foster and Kuhn, 2007; 
Civera and Juan, 2007; Lv et al., 2007) framework. 
However,  these approaches focused on the studies of 
bilingual corpus synthesis and exploitation  while ig- 
noring the monolingual  corpora, therefore limiting 
the potential of further translation quality improve- 
ment.
  In  this paper, we propose a  novel adaptation 
method to adapt the translation model for domain- 
specific translation task by  utilizing  in-domain

monolingual corpora. Our approach is inspired by 
the recent studies (Zhao and Xing, 2006; Zhao and 
Xing, 2007; Tam et al., 2007; Gong and Zhou, 2010; 
Ruiz and Federico, 2011) which have shown that a 
particular translation always appears in some spe- 
cific topical contexts, and the topical context infor- 
mation has a great effect on translation selection. 
For example, “bank” often occurs in the sentences 
related to the economy topic when translated into 
“y´inha´ng”, and occurs in the sentences related to the 
geography topic when translated to “he´a`n”.  There- 
fore, the co-occurrence frequency of the phrases in 
some specific context can be used to constrain the 
translation candidates of phrases. In a monolingual 
corpus, if “bank” occurs more often in the sentences 
related to the economy topic than the ones related 
to the geography topic, it is more likely that “bank” 
is translated to “y´inha´ng” than to “he´a`n”.  With the 
out-of-domain bilingual corpus, we first incorporate 
the topic information into translation probability es- 
timation, aiming to quantify the effect of the topical 
context information on translation selection. Then, 
we rescore all phrase pairs according to the phrase- 
topic and the word-topic posterior distributions of 
the additional in-domain monolingual corpora. As 
compared to the previous works, our method takes 
advantage of both the in-domain monolingual cor- 
pora and the out-of-domain bilingual corpus to in- 
corporate the topic information into our translation 
model, thus breaking down the corpus barrier for 
translation quality improvement. The experimental


effect on the performance of SMT system. 
Phrase probability measures the co-occurrence 
frequency of a phrase pair, and lexical probability 
is used to vali- date the quality of the phrase pair 
by checking how well its words are translated to 
each other.
  According to the definition proposed by  
(Koehn et al., 2003), given a source  sentence f  
= f J   = f1, . . . , fj , . . . , fJ , a  target sentence  
e  = eI    = e1, . . . , ei, . . . , eI , and its word 
alignment a which is a subset of the Cartesian 
product of word position-
s: a ⊆ (j, i) : j = 1, . . . , J ; i = 1, . . . , I , the 
phrase
pair (f˜, e˜)  is said to be consistent (Och and 
Ney,
2004) with the alignment if and only if:  (1) 
there must be at least one word inside one phrase 
aligned to a word inside the other phrase and (2) 
no words inside one phrase can be aligned to a 
word outside the other phrase. After all consistent 
phrase pairs are extracted from training corpus, 
the phrase probabil- ities are estimated  as 
relative frequencies (Och and Ney, 2004):

count(f˜, 
e˜)
φ(e˜ f˜) =

count(f , e˜

Here count(f˜, e˜) indicates how often the phrase 
pair
(f˜, e˜) occurs in the training 
corpus.
  To obtain the corresponding lexical weight, 
we first estimate a lexical translation probability 
distri-
bution w(e|f ) by relative frequency from the 
train-
ing 
corpus:

2   Background

The statistical translation model, which contains 
phrase pairs with bi-directional phrase probabilities 
and bi-directional lexical probabilities, has a great


However,  the  above-mentioned   method only
counts the co-occurrence  frequency of  
bilingual phrases, assuming that the translation 
probability is independent of the context 
information. Thus, the statistical model 
estimated from the training data is not suitable for 
text translation in different domains, resulting in a 
significant  drop in translation quality.


3   Translation Model Adaptation via
Monolingual Topic Information

In this section, we first briefly review the principle 
of Hidden Topic Markov Model(HTMM) which is 
the basis of our method, then describe our approach 
to translation model adaptation in detail.

3.1   Hidden Topic Markov Model

During the last couple of years, topic models such 
as  Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (Hof- 
mann, 1999) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation mod- 
el (Blei, 2003), have drawn more and more attention 
and been applied successfully in NLP community. 
Based on the “bag-of-words” assumption that the or- 
der of words can be ignored,  these methods model 
the text corpus by using a co-occurrence  matrix of 
words and documents, and build generative model- 
s to infer the latent aspects or topics. Using these 
models, the words can be clustered into the derived 
topics with a probability distribution,  and the corre- 
lation between words can be automatically captured 
via topics.
  However, the “bag-of-words” assumption is an 
unrealistic oversimplification because it ignores the 
order of words. To remedy this problem, Gruber et 
al.(2007) propose HTMM, which models the topics


3.2   Adapted Phrase Probability Estimation

We  utilize the additional in-domain 
monolingual corpora to adapt the out-of-domain 
translation mod- el for domain-specific translation 
task. In detail, we build an adapted translation 
model in the following steps:
• Build  a  topic-specific translation model to 
quantify the effect of the topic information on 
the translation probability estimation.
• Estimate the topic posterior distributions of 
phrases in the in-domain monolingual 
corpora.
• Score the phrase pairs according to the 
prede- fined topic-specific translation model 
and the topic posterior distribution of 
phrases.

  Formally, we incorporate monolingual topic in- 
formation into  translation probability estimation,
and decompose the phrase probability φ(e˜|f˜)1   as
follows:

φ(e˜
|f˜)
=

where φ(e˜|f˜, tf ) indicates the probability of trans-


of words in the document  as a Markov chain. Based

on the assumption that all words in the same sen-
tence have the same topic and the successive sen- 
tences are more likely to have the same topic, HTM- 
M incorporates the local dependency between words 
by Hidden Markov Model for better topic estima- 
tion.
  HTMM  can also be viewed as a soft clustering 
tool for words in training corpus.  That is, HT- 
MM  can estimate the probability distribution of a 
topic over words, i.e.  the topic-word distribution
P (word|topic)  during training.  Besides, HTMM
derives inherent topics in sentences rather than in

documents, so we can easily obtain the sentence- 
topic  distribution P (topic|sentence)  in  training
corpus.   Adopting maximum likelihood estima- 
tion(MLE), this posterior distribution makes it pos- 
sible to effectively calculate the word-topic distri-
bution P (topic|word) and the phrase-topic distribu-


P (tf |f˜) denotes the phrase-topic distribution of f˜.
To compute φ(e˜|f˜), we first apply HTMM to re-
spectively train two monolingual topic models with
the following  corpora: one is the source part of 
the out-of-domain bilingual corpus Cf  out, the oth- 
er is the in-domain monolingual corpus Cf  in in the 
source language. Then, we respectively  estimate
φ(e˜|f˜, tf ) and P (tf |f˜) from these two corpora. To 
avoid confusion, we further refine φ(e˜|f˜, tf ) and 
P (tf |f˜) with φ(e˜|f˜, tf out) and P (tf  in|f˜), 
respec-
tively.  Here, tf out  is the topic clustered from the 
corpus Cf  out, and tf in represents the topic 
derived from the corpus Cf  in.
However, the two above-mentioned probabilities
can not be directly multiplied in formula (4) be- 
cause they are related to different topic spaces from

different corpora. Besides, their topic dimension- 
s  are not assured  to be the same.  To solve this 
problem, we introduce the topic mapping probabili-
ty P (tf  out|tf  in) to map the in-domain phrase-topic
distribution into the one in the out-domain topic s-
pace. To be specific, we obtain the out-of-domain

use the words belonging to both corpora during the 
mapping procedure.  Specifically, we decompose
P (tf  out|tf  in) as follows:
P (tf  out|tf  in)


phrase-topic distribution P (tf  out|f˜) as follows:


=

P (tf  out|f˜) = ) P (tf  out|tf  in) · P (tf  in|f˜)   (5)
tf  in

  Thus formula (4) can be further refined as the fol- 
lowing formula:


Here we first get P (f |tf  in) directly from the top- 
ic model related to Cf  in.   Then, considering the
sentence-topic distribution  P (tf  out|f ) from the rel-
evant topic model of Cf  out,  we define the word- 
topic distribution P (tf  out|f ) as:
P (tf  out|f )

Next we will give detailed descriptions of the cal-

culation methods for the three probability distribu- 
tions mentioned in formula (6).

3.2.1   Topic-Specific Phrase Translation
Probability φ(e˜|f˜, tf out)
We follow  the common practice (Koehn et al.,
2003) to calculate the topic-specific  phrase trans- 
lation probability, and the only difference is that 
our method takes the topical context information in- 
to account when collecting the fractional counts of 
phrase pairs.  With the sentence-topic distribution
P (tf  out|f ) from the relevant topic model of Cf  out,
the conditional probability φ(e˜|f˜, tf out) can be eas-
ily obtained by MLE method:

φ(e˜|f˜, tf out)
count f ,e (f˜, e˜) · P (tf  out|f )


where countf (f ) denotes the number of the word f
in sentence f .
3.2.3	Phrase-Topic Distribution P (tf  in|f˜)
  A simple way to compute the phrase-topic distri- 
bution is to take the fractional counts from Cf  in 
and then adopt MLE to obtain relative probability. 
However, it is infeasible in our model because some 
phrases occur in Cf  out  while being absent in Cf  in. 
To solve this problem, we further compute this pos- 
terior distribution by the interpolation of two model- 
s:
P (tf  in|f˜)   =  θ · Pmle(tf  in|f˜) +
(1 − θ) · Pword(tf  in|f˜)  (10)
where Pmle(tf  in|f˜) indicates the phrase-topic dis- 
tribution  by  MLE,   Pword(tf  in|f˜)   denotes the

where Cout  is the out-of-domain bilingual training 
corpus, and count f ,e (f˜, e˜) denotes the number of 
the phrase pair (f˜, e˜) in sentence pair  f , ee.
3.2.2   Topic Mapping Probability P (tf  out|tf  in)
  Based on the two monolingual topic models re- 
spectively trained from Cf  in and Cf  out, we com-


over the development data.
  Given the number of the phrase f˜ in sentence f 
denoted  as countf (f˜),  we compute the in-domain 
phrase-topic distribution in the following way:
Pmle(tf  in|f˜)
countf (f˜) · P (tf  in|f )
f ∈Cf  in

word f as the pivot variable.  Noticing that there

f )


  Under the assumption that the topics of all word- 
s in the same phrase are independent,  we consid-
er two methods to calculate Pword(tf  in|f˜).  One is
a “Noisy-OR” combination  method (Zens and Ney,
2004) which has shown good performance in calcu- 
lating similarities between bags-of-words in differ-
ent languages. Using this method, Pword(tf  in|f˜) is
defined as:
Pword(tf  in|f˜)
=  1 − Pword(t¯f  in|f˜)
≈  1 − n P (t¯f  in|fj )
fj ∈f˜
=  1 − n (1 − P (tf  in|fj )) 	(12)


4   Experiment

We evaluate our method on the Chinese-to-English 
translation task for the weblog text. After a brief de- 
scription of the experimental  setup, we investigate 
the effects of various factors on the translation sys- 
tem performance.

4.1   Experimental  setup

In our experiments, the out-of-domain training cor- 
pus comes from the FBIS corpus and the Hansard- 
s part of LDC2004T07 corpus (54.6K  documents 
with 1M parallel  sentences, 25.2M Chinese words 
and 29M English words). We use the Chinese Sohu 
weblog in 20091 and the English Blog Authorship

(Schler  et al., 2006) as the 
in-domain mono-



where Pword(t¯f  in|f˜) represents the probability that 
tf in is not the topic of the phrase f˜.   Similarly, 
P (t¯f  in|fj ) indicates the probability that tf in is not
the topic of the word fj .
  The other method is an “Averaging” combination 
one. With the assumption that tf in is the topic of f˜ 
if at least one of the words in f˜ belongs to this topic, 
we derive Pword(tf  in|f˜) as follows:


lingual corpora in the source language and target
language, respectively. To obtain more accurate top- 
ic information by HTMM, we firstly filter the noisy 
blog documents and the ones consisting of short sen- 
tences. After filtering, there are totally 85K Chinese 
blog documents with 2.1M sentences and 277K En- 
glish blog documents with 4.3M sentences used in 
our experiments. Then, we sample equal numbers of 
documents from the in-domain monolingual corpo- 
ra in the source language and the target language to

respectively train two in-domain topic 
models. The web part of the 2006 NIST 
MT evaluation test da-


where |f˜  denotes the number of words in phrase f˜.

3.3   Adapted Lexical Probability Estimation

Now we briefly describe how to estimate the adapted 
lexical weight for phrase pairs, which can be adjust- 
ed in a similar way to the phrase probability.
  Specifically, adopting our method,  each word is 
considered   as one phrase  consisting of only one 
word, so


ta, consisting of 27 documents with 1048 sentences, 
is used as the development  set, and the weblog  part 
of the 2008 NIST MT test data, including 33 docu- 
ments with 666 sentences, is our test set.
  To obtain various topic distributions for the out- 
of-domain training corpus and the in-domain mono- 
lingual corpora in the source language and the tar- 
get language respectively, we use HTMM tool devel- 
oped by Gruber et al.(2007) to conduct topic model
training. During this process, we empirically set the


w(e|f )   =	)


) w(e|f, tf out)



same parameter values 
for the HTMM training 
of d-


tf  out tf  in
·P (tf  out|tf  in) · P (tf  in|f ) (14)

Here  we   obtain  w(e|f, tf out)    with   a    simi- 
lar   approach to   φ(e˜|f˜, tf out),    and  calculate 
P (tf  out|tf  in)  and  P (tf  in|f )   by  resorting to
formulas (8) and (9).
  With the adjusted lexical translation probability, 
we resort to formula (4) to update the lexical weight 
for the phrase pair (f˜, e˜).


ifferent corpora: topics = 50, α = 1.5, β = 1.01, 
iters   = 100.  See   (Gruber et al., 2007) for the 
meanings of these parameters.  Besides, we set the 
interpolation weight θ in formula (10) to 0.5 by ob- 
serving the results on development  set in the addi- 
tional experiments.

phrase-based  machine translation system (Koehn 
et al.,  2007), as  the experimental  decoder. 
GIZA++  (Och and Ney, 2003) and the heuristics 
“grow-diag-final-and” are used to generate a word- 
aligned corpus, from which we extract  bilingual 
phrases with maximum length 7.  We use SRILM 
Toolkits (Stolcke, 2002) to train two 4-gram lan- 
guage models on the filtered English Blog Author- 
ship corpus and the Xinhua portion of Gigaword 
corpus, respectively. During decoding, we set the 
ttable-limit as 20, the stack-size  as 100, and per- 
form minimum-error-rate  training (Och and Ney,
2003) to tune the feature weights for the log-linear 
model.   The translation quality is evaluated  by 
case-insensitive BLEU-4 metric  (Papineni et al.,
2002). Finally, we conduct paired bootstrap sam- 
pling (Koehn, 2004) to test the significance in BLEU 
score differences.

4.2   Result and Analysis

4.2.1   Effect of Different Smoothing Methods
  Our first experiments investigate the effect of dif- 
ferent smoothing methods for the in-domain phrase- 
topic distribution:  “Noisy-OR”  and “Averaging”. 
We build adapted phrase tables with these two meth- 
ods, and then respectively  use them in place of the 
out-of-domain phrase table to test the system perfor- 
mance. For the purpose of studying the generality of 
our approach, we carry out comparative experiments 
on two sizes of in-domain monolingual corpora: 5K 
and 40K .


BLEU scores acquired  by two methods are 20.45 
and 20.54, achieving absolute improvements of 0.23 
and 0.32 on the test set, respectively. In the exper- 
iments with the large-scale monolingual in-
domain corpora, similar results are obtained, with 
absolute improvements of 0.54 and 0.89 over the 
baseline system.
  From the above experimental  results, we know 
that both “Noisy-OR” and “Averaging” 
combination methods improve  the performance 
over the base- line, and “Averaging”  method  
seems to be slight- ly better.  This finding fails 
to echo the promis- ing results in the previous 
study (Zens and Ney,
2004). This is because the “Noisy-OR” method in- 
volves the multiplication of the word-topic distribu- 
tion (shown in formula (12)), which leads to much 
sharper phrase-topic  distribution than “Averaging” 
method, and is more likely to introduce bias to the 
translation probability estimation. Due to this 
rea- son, all the following experiments only 
consider the “Averaging”method.

4.2.2   Effect of Combining Two Phrase Tables

  In the above experiments, we replace the out-of- 
domain phrase table with the adapted phrase table. 
Here we combine these two phrase tables in a log- 
linear framework to see if we could obtain further 
improvement. To offer a clear description, we 
repre- sent the out-of-domain  phrase table and the 
adapted phrase table with “OutBP” and “AdapBP”, 
respec- tively.

ter produces further improvements over the former. 
Specifically, the BLEU  scores  of  the “OutBP + 
AdapBP” method are 20.70 and 21.20, which ob- 
tain 0.48 and 0.98 points higher than the baseline 
method, and 0.16 and 0.09 points higher than the
‘AdapBP” method. The underlying reason is that the 
probability distribution of each in-domain  sentence 
often converges on some topics in the “AdapBP” 
method and some translation probabilities  are over- 
estimated,  which leads to negative effects on the 
translation quality. By using two tables together, our 
approach reduces the bias introduced by “AdapBP”, 
therefore further improving the translation quality.

4.2.3   Effect of In-domain Monolingual Corpus
Size
  Finally, we investigate the effect of in-domain 
monolingual  corpus size on translation quality.  In 
the experiment, we try different sizes of in-domain 
documents to train different monolingual topic mod- 
els: from 5K to 80K with an increment of 5K each 
time.  Note that here we only focus on the exper- 
iments using the “OutBP + AdapBP” method, be- 
cause this method performs better in the previous 
experiments.
  Figure 1 shows the BLEU scores of the transla- 
tion system on the test set. It can be seen that the 
more data, the better translation quality when the 
corpus size is less than 30K .  The overall BLEU 
scores corresponding  to the range of great N  val- 
ues are generally  higher than the ones correspond- 
ing to the range of small N values. For example, the 
BLEU scores under the condition within the range 
[25K, 80K ] are all higher than the ones within the 
range [5K, 20K ]. When N is set to 55K , the BLEU



score of our system is 21.40, with 1.18 gains on the 
baseline system. This difference is statistically sig- 
nificant at P < 0.01 using the significance test tool 
developed by Zhang et al.(2004). For this experi- 
mental result, we speculate that with the increment 
of in-domain monolingual data, the corresponding 
topic models provide more accurate topic informa- 
tion to improve the translation system. However, 
this effect weakens when the monolingual corpora 
continue to increase.

5   Related work

Most previous researches about translation model 
adaptation focused on parallel data collection. For 
example, Hildebrand et al.(2005) employed infor- 
mation retrieval technology to gather the bilingual 
sentences,  which are similar to the test set, from 
available in-domain and out-of-domain training da- 
ta to build an adaptive  translation model.   With 
the same motivation, Munteanu and Marcu (2005) 
extracted in-domain bilingual sentence pairs from 
comparable  corpora.  Since large-scale  monolin- 
gual corpus is easier to obtain than parallel corpus, 
there have been some studies  on how to generate 
parallel sentences with monolingual sentences.  In 
this respect, Ueffing et al.  (2008) explored semi- 
supervised learning to obtain synthetic parallel sen- 
tences,  and Wu et al.  (2008) used an in-domain 
translation dictionary and monolingual corpora to 
adapt an out-of-domain translation model for the in- 
domain text.
  Differing  from the above-mentioned  works on 
the acquirement of bilingual resource, several stud- 
ies (Foster and Kuhn, 2007; Civera and Juan, 2007; 
Lv et al., 2007) adopted mixture  modeling frame- 
work to exploit the full potential of the existing par- 
allel corpus. Under this framework, the training cor- 
pus is first divided into different parts, each of which 
is used to train a sub translation  model, then these 
sub models are used together with different weights 
during decoding. In addition, discriminative weight- 
ing methods were proposed to assign appropriate 
weights to the sentences from training corpus (Mat- 
soukas et al., 2009) or the phrase pairs of phrase ta- 
ble (Foster et al., 2010). Final experimental result- 
s show that without using any additional resources, 
these approaches all improve SMT performance sig-


nificantly.
  Our method deals with translation model adap- 
tation by making use of the topical context, so let 
us take  a look at the recent research developmen- 
t on the application of topic models in SMT. As- 
suming each bilingual sentence constitutes  a mix- 
ture of hidden topics and each word pair follows a 
topic-specific bilingual translation model, Zhao and 
Xing (2006,2007)  presented a bilingual topical ad- 
mixture formalism to improve word alignment by 
capturing topic sharing at different levels of linguis- 
tic granularity. Tam et al.(2007)  proposed a bilin- 
gual LSA, which enforces one-to-one topic corre- 
spondence and enables latent topic distributions to 
be efficiently transferred across languages, to cross- 
lingual language modeling and translation lexicon 
adaptation. Recently, Gong and Zhou (2010) also 
applied topic modeling into domain adaptation in 
SMT. Their method employed one additional feature 
function to capture the topic inherent in the source 
phrase and help the decoder dynamically  choose re- 
lated target phrases according  to the specific topic of 
the source phrase.
  Besides, our approach is also related to context- 
dependent translation. Recent studies have shown 
that SMT  systems  can benefit from  the utiliza- 
tion of context information. For example, trigger- 
based lexicon model (Hasan et al., 2008; Mauser et 
al., 2009) and context-dependent translation selec- 
tion (Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007; He 
et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008). The former gener- 
ated triplets to capture long-distance  dependencies 
that go beyond the local context of phrases, and the 
latter built the classifiers which combine rich con- 
text information to better select translation  during 
decoding. With the consideration of various local 
context features, these approaches all yielded stable 
improvements on different translation tasks.
  As compared to the above-mentioned works, our 
work has the following differences.
• We focus on how to adapt a translation  mod- 
el for domain-specific translation task with the 
help of additional in-domain monolingual cor-
pora, which are far from full exploitation in the 
parallel data collection and mixture modeling 
framework.
• In  addition to  the utilization  of  in-domain


monolingual corpora, our method is differen- 
t from the previous works (Zhao and Xing,
2006; Zhao and Xing, 2007; Tam et al., 2007; 
Gong and Zhou, 2010) in the following aspect- 
s: (1) we use a different topic model — HTMM 
which  has different assumption from PLSA and 
LDA; (2) rather than modeling topic-dependent 
translation lexicons in the training process, we 
estimate  topic-specific lexical probability by 
taking account of topical context when extract- 
ing word pairs, so our method can also be di- 
rectly applied to topic-dependent phrase proba- 
bility modeling. (3) Instead of rescoring phrase 
pairs online, our approach calculate the transla- 
tion probabilities offline, which brings no addi- 
tional burden to translation systems and is suit- 
able to translate the texts without the topic dis- 
tribution information.
• Different from trigger-based lexicon model and 
context-dependent translation  selection both of 
which put emphasis on solving the translation
ambiguity by the exploitation of the context in- 
formation at the sentence level, we adopt the 
topical context information in our method for 
the following reasons:  (1) the topic informa- 
tion captures the context information beyond 
the scope of sentence; (2) the topical context in- 
formation is integrated into the posterior prob- 
ability distribution, avoiding the sparseness of 
word or POS features; (3) the topical context 
information allows for more fine-grained dis- 
tinction of different translations than the genre 
information of corpus.

6   Conclusion and future work

This paper presents a novel method for SMT sys- 
tem adaptation by making use of the monolingual 
corpora in new domains. Our approach first esti- 
mates the translation probabilities from the out-of- 
domain bilingual corpus given the topic information, 
and then rescores the phrase pairs via topic mapping 
and phrase-topic distribution probability estimation 
from in-domain monolingual corpora. Experimental 
results show that our method achieves better perfor- 
mance than the baseline system, without increasing 
the burden of the translation system.
In the future, we will  verify our method on oth-


er language pairs, for example, Chinese to Japanese. 
Furthermore, since the in-domain phrase-topic dis- 
tribution is currently estimated with simple smooth- 
ing interpolations, we expect that the translation sys- 
tem could benefit from other sophisticated smooth- 
ing methods. Finally, the reasonable estimation of 
topic number for better translation model adaptation 
will also become our study emphasis.
