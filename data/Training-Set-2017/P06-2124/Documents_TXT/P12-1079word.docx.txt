Abstract

Previous  work  using  topic  model  for statis- 
tical machine translation (SMT) explore top- 
ic  information  at  the  word  level.    Howev- 
er, SMT has been advanced from word-based 
paradigm to phrase/rule-based  paradigm.  We 
therefore propose a topic similarity model to 
exploit topic information at the synchronous 
rule level for hierarchical phrase-based trans- 
lation.   We associate  each synchronous  rule 
with a topic distribution,  and select desirable 
rules according to the similarity of their top- 
ic  distributions  with  given  documents.    We 
show  that  our  model  significantly  improves 
the translation performance over the baseline 
on NIST Chinese-to-English translation ex- 
periments.  Our model also achieves a better 
performance and a faster speed than previous 
approaches that work at the word level.


1    Introduction

Topic model (Hofmann, 1999; Blei et al., 2003) is 
a popular technique for discovering the underlying 
topic structure of documents. To exploit topic infor- 
mation for statistical machine translation (SMT), re- 
searchers have proposed various topic-specific lexi- 
con translation models (Zhao and Xing, 2006; Zhao 
and Xing, 2007; Tam et al., 2007) to improve trans- 
lation quality.
  Topic-specific  lexicon  translation  models  focus 
on word-level translations.   Such models first esti- 
mate word translation probabilities conditioned on 
topics,  and then  adapt  lexical  weights  of phrases

by these probabilities.   However,  the state-of-the- 
art SMT systems translate sentences by using se- 
quences of synchronous rules or phrases, instead of 
translating word by word. Since a synchronous rule 
is rarely factorized into individual words, we believe 
that it is more reasonable to incorporate the topic 
model directly at the rule level rather than the word 
level.
  Consequently,   we  propose   a  topic   similari- 
ty model for hierarchical phrase-based translation 
(Chiang, 2007), where each synchronous rule is as- 
sociated with a topic distribution. In particular,
• Given  a  document  to  be  translated,  we  cal- 
culate the topic similarity between a rule and 
the document based on their topic distributions.
We augment the hierarchical phrase-based sys- 
tem by integrating the proposed topic similarity 
model as a new feature (Section 3.1).
• As we will discuss in Section 3.2, the similarity 
between a generic rule and a given source docu- 
ment computed by our topic similarity model is
often very low. We don’t want to penalize these 
generic rules.  Therefore we further propose a 
topic sensitivity model which rewards generic 
rules so as to complement the topic similarity 
model.
• We estimate  the topic  distribution  for a rule 
based on both the source and target side topic 
models (Section 4.1). In order to calculate sim-
ilarities between target-side topic distributions 
of rules and source-side topic distributions of 
given documents during decoding, we project

the target-side topic distributions of rules into 
the space of source-side topic model by one-to- 
many projection (Section 4.2).

  Experiments on Chinese-English translation tasks 
(Section 6) show that, our method outperforms the 
baseline  hierarchial  phrase-based  system  by  +0.9
BLE U points.  This result is also +0.5 points high- 
er and 3 times faster than the previous topic-specific 
lexicon translation method.   We further show that 
both the source-side and target-side topic distribu- 
tions improve translation quality and their improve- 
ments are complementary to each other.

2    Background: Topic Model

A topic  model  is used  for discovering  the topics 
that occur in a collection of documents.  Both La- 
tent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) 
and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) 
(Hofmann, 1999) are types of topic models.  LDA 
is the most common topic model currently in use, 
therefore we exploit it for mining topics in this pa- 
per. Here, we first give a brief description of LDA.
  LDA views each document as a mixture pro- 
portion of various topics, and generates each word 
by multinomial distribution conditioned on a topic. 
More specifically, as a generative process, LDA first 
samples a document-topic distribution for each doc- 
ument. Then, for each word in the document, it sam- 
ples a topic index from the document-topic distribu- 
tion and samples the word conditioned on the topic 
index according the topic-word distribution.
  Generally speaking, LDA contains two types of 
parameters.  The first one relates to the document- 
topic distribution, which records the topic distribu- 
tion of each document.  The second one is used for 
topic-word distribution, which represents each topic


as a distribution over words. Based on these param- 
eters (and some hyper-parameters), LDA can infer a 
topic assignment for each word in the documents. In 
the following sections, we will use these parameters 
and the topic assignments of words to estimate the 
parameters in our method.

3    Topic Similarity Model

Sentences should be translated in consistence with 
their topics (Zhao and Xing, 2006; Zhao and Xing,
2007; Tam et al., 2007).  In the hierarchical phrase 
based system, a synchronous rule may be related to 
some topics and unrelated to others.  In terms of 
probability, a rule often has an uneven probability 
distribution over topics. The probability over a topic 
is high if the rule is highly related to the topic, other- 
wise the probability will be low. Therefore, we use 
topic distribution to describe the relatedness of rules 
to topics.
Figure 1 shows four synchronous rules (Chiang,
2007) with topic distributions, some of which con- 
tain nonterminals.  We can see that, although the 
source part of rule (b) and (c) are identical, their top- 
ic distributions are quite different. Rule (b) contains 
a highest probability on the topic about “China-U.S. 
relationship”, which means rule (b) is much more 
related to this topic.   In contrast, rule (c) contains 
an even distribution over various topics.  Thus, giv- 
en a document about “China-U.S. relationship”, we 
hope to encourage the system to apply rule (b) but 
penalize the application of rule (c). We achieve this 
by calculating similarity between the topic distribu- 
tions of a rule and a document to be translated.
  More formally, we associate each rule with a rule- 
topic distribution P (z|r), where r is a rule, and z is
a topic. Suppose there are K topics, this distribution


can be represented by a K -dimension vector.  The
k-th component P (z  = k|r) means the probability
of topic k given the rule r.  The estimation of such
distribution will be described in Section 4.
  Analogously, we represent the topic information 
of a document d to be translated by a document-
topic  distribution  P (z|d),   which  is  also  a  K -
dimension vector.  The k-th dimension P (z  = k|d)
means the probability of topic k given document d.
Different from rule-topic distribution, the document- 
topic distribution can be directly inferred by an off- 
the-shelf LDA tool.
  Consequently,  based  on these  two  distribution- 
s, we select a rule for a document  to be translat- 
ed according to their topic similarity (Section 3.1), 
which measures the relatedness of the rule to the 
document.   In order to encourage  the application 
of generic rules which are often penalized by our 
similarity model, we also propose a topic sensitivity 
model (Section 3.2).

3.1    Topic Similarity

By comparing the similarity of their topic distribu- 
tions, we are able to decide whether a rule is suitable 
for a given source document.  The topic similarity 
computes the distance of two topic distributions. We 
calculate the topic similarity by Hellinger function:
Similarity(P (z|d), P (z|r))
K


rules according to their topic distributions.   Let’s 
revisit Figure 1.  We can easily find that the topic 
distribution of rule (c) distribute evenly.  This in- 
dicates that it is insensitive to topics, and can be 
applied in any topics.  We call such a rule a topic- 
insensitive rule. In contrast, the distributions of the 
rest rules peak on a few topics. Such rules are called 
topic-sensitive rules.  Generally speaking, a topic- 
insensitive rule has a fairly flat distribution, while a 
topic-sensitive rule has a sharp distribution.
  A document typically focuses on a few topics, and 
has a sharp topic distribution. In contrast, the distri- 
bution of topic-insensitive rule is fairly flat. Hence, 
a topic-insensitive rule is always less similar to doc- 
uments and is punished by the similarity function.
  However, topic-insensitive rules may be more 
preferable  than  topic-sensitive  rules  if  neither  of 
them are similar to given documents.  For a doc- 
ument about the “military” topic, the rule (b) and 
(c) in Figure 1 are both dissimilar to the document, 
because rule (b) relates to the “China-U.S. relation- 
ship” topic and rule (c) is topic-insensitive.  Never- 
theless, since rule (c) occurs more frequently across 
various topics, it may be better to apply rule (c).
  To address such issue of the topic similarity mod- 
el, we further introduce a topic sensitivity model to 
describe the topic sensitivity of a rule using entropy 
as a metric:


 	  √ 	2


Sensitivity(P (z|r))


= ∑ (√P (z = k|d) −
k=1


P (z = k|r))


(1)



K
= − ∑ P (z = k|r) × log (P 
(z = k|r))	(2)


Hellinger function is used to calculate distribution
distance and is popular in topic model (Blei and Laf- 
ferty, 2007).1  By topic similarity, we aim to encour- 
age or penalize the application of a rule for a giv- 
en document according to their topic distributions, 
which then helps the SMT system make better trans- 
lation decisions.

3.2    Topic Sensitivity

Domain adaptation (Wu et al., 2008; Bertoldi and 
Federico, 2009) often distinguishes general-domain 
data from in-domain data.  Similarly, we divide the 
rules into topic-insensitive rules and topic-sensitive

  1 We also try other distance functions,  including  Euclidean 
distance,   Kullback-Leibler   divergence   and  cosine  function. 
They produce similar results in our preliminary experiments.


k=1

According to the Eq. (2), a topic-insensitive rule has 
a large entropy, while a topic-sensitive rule has a s- 
maller entropy. By incorporating the topic sensitivi- 
ty model with the topic similarity model, we enable 
our SMT system to balance the selection of these t- 
wo types of rules.  Given rules with approximately 
equal values of Eq.  (1), we prefer topic-insensitive 
rules.

4    Estimation

Unlike document-topic distribution that can be di- 
rectly learned by LDA tools, we need to estimate the 
rule-topic distribution according to our requirement. 
In this paper, we try to exploit the topic information


of both source and target language.  To achieve this 
goal, we use both source-side and target-side mono- 
lingual topic models, and learn the correspondence 
between the two topic models from word-aligned 
bilingual corpus.
  Specifically, we use two types of rule-topic dis- 
tributions: one is source-side rule-topic distribution 
and the other is target-side rule-topic distribution. 
These two rule-topic distributions are estimated by 
corresponding topic models in the same way (Sec- 
tion 4.1). Notably, only source language documents 
are available during decoding.  In order to compute


bution of every documents inferred by LDA tool.
  We first extract synchronous rules from training 
data in a traditional way. When a rule r is extracted
from a document d with topic distribution P (z|d),
we collect an instance (r, P (z|d), c), where c is the
fraction count of an instance as described in Chiang,
(2007).  After extraction, we get a set of instances
I = {(r, P (z|d), c)} with different document-topic
distributions for each rule.   Using these instances, 
we calculate the topic probability P (z   = k|r)  as
follows:
∑	c	P (z = k d)

P (z = k|r) =   	I ∈I     × 	|

tion of a rule and the source-side topic distribution 
of a given document，we need to project the target-

∑I ∈I c × P (z = k′|d)


side topic distribution of a synchronous rule into the 
space of the source-side topic model (Section 4.2).
  A more principle way is to learn a bilingual topic 
model from bilingual corpus (Mimno et al., 2009). 
However, we may face difficulty during decoding, 
where only source language documents are avail- 
able. It requires a marginalization to infer the mono- 
lingual topic distribution using the bilingual topic 
model. The high complexity of marginalization pro- 
hibits such a summation in practice. Previous work 
on bilingual topic model avoid this problem by some 
monolingual assumptions.  Zhao and Xing (2007) 
assume that the topic model is generated in a mono- 
lingual manner, while Tam et al., (2007) construct 
their bilingual topic model by enforcing a one-to- 
one correspondence between two monolingual topic 
models. We also estimate our rule-topic distribution 
by two monolingual topic models, but use a differ- 
ent way to project target-side topics onto source-side 
topics.

4.1    Monolingual Topic Distribution Estimation

We estimate rule-topic distribution from word- 
aligned  bilingual  training  corpus  with  documen- 
t  boundaries explicitly given.   The source and tar- 
get side distributions are estimated in the same way. 
For simplicity, we only describe the estimation of 
source-side distribution in this section.
  The process of rule-topic distribution estimation 
is analogous to the traditional estimation of rule 
translation probability (Chiang, 2007).  In addition 
to the word-aligned corpus, the input for estimation 
also contains the source-side topic-document distri-


By   using   both   source-side    and   target-side
document-topic  distribution,  we  obtain  two  rule- 
topic distributions for each rule in total.

4.2    Target-side Topic Distribution Projection

As described in the previous section, we also esti- 
mate the target-side rule-topic distribution.  How- 
ever, only source document-topic distributions are 
available  during  decoding.    In  order  to  calculate 
the similarity between the target-side rule-topic dis- 
tribution of a rule and the source-side document- 
topic distribution of a source document, we need to 
project target-side topics into the source-side topic 
space. The projection contains two steps:

• In the first step, we learn the topic-to-topic cor- 
respondence probability p(zf |ze ) from target-
side topic ze  to source-side topic zf .
• In the second step, we project the target-side 
topic distribution of a rule into source-side top- 
ic space using the correspondence probability.

  In the first step, we estimate the correspondence 
probability by the co-occurrence of the source-side 
and the target-side topic assignment of the word- 
aligned corpus.   The topic assignments  are output 
by LDA tool.  Thus, we denotes each sentence pair 
by (zf , ze , a),  where  zf    and ze  are the topic as- 
signments of source-side and target-side sentences
respectively,  and  a  is a set  of  links  {(i, j)}.    A
link (i, j) means a source-side position i aligns to
a target-side position j.  Thus, the co-occurrence of 
a source-side topic with index kf   and a target-side

Table 1: Example of topic-to-topic correspondence.  The 
last line shows the correspondence probability. Each col- 
umn means a topic represented by its top-10 topical word- 
s.  The first column is a target-side topic, while the rest 
three columns are source-side topics.


topic ke  is calculated by:
∑	∑ δ(zf  , kf ) ∗ δ(ze   , ke ) 	(4)
i	j
(zf ,ze ,a) (i,j)∈a

where δ(x, y) is the Kronecker function, which is 1

if x = y and 0 otherwise.  We then compute the 
probability of P (z  = kf |z  = ke ) by normalizing
the co-occurrence count. Overall, after the first step, 
we obtain an correspondence matrix MKe ×Kf   from 
target-side topic to source-side topic, where the item
Mi,j represents the probability P (zf  = i|ze  = j).
In the second step, given the correspondence ma-

trix MKe ×Kf , we project the target-side rule-topic 
distribution P (ze |r)  to the source-side topic space
by multiplication as follows:

       T (P (ze |r)) = P (ze |r) ⊗ MKe ×Kf	(5) 
In this way, we get a second distribution for a rule

in the source-side topic space, which we called pro- 
jected target-side topic distribution T (P (ze |r)).
  Obviously, our projection method allows one 
target-side topic to align to multiple source-side top- 
ics. This is different from the one-to-one correspon- 
dence used by Tam et al., (2007). From the training 
result of the correspondence  matrix MKe ×Kf , we 
find that the topic correspondence  between source 
and target language  is not necessarily  one-to-one.
Typically, the probability P (z  = kf |z  = ke ) of a
target-side topic mainly distributes on two or three
source-side  topics.   Table 1 shows an example of 
a target-side topic with its three mainly aligned 
source-side topics.



5    Decoding

We  incorporate  our  topic  similarity  model  as  a 
new  feature  into  a traditional  hiero  system  (Chi- 
ang,  2007)  under  discriminative  framework  (Och 
and Ney,  2002).   Considering  there are a source- 
side rule-topic  distribution  and a projected  target- 
side rule-topic distribution, we add four features in 
total:
• Similarity (P (zf |d), P (zf |r))
• Similarity(P (zf |d), T (P (ze |r)))
• Sensitivity(P (zf |r))
• Sensitivity(T (P (ze |r))

To calculate the total score of a derivation on each 
feature listed above during decoding, we sum up the 
correspondent feature score of each applied rule.2
  The source-side and projected target-side rule- 
topic distribution are calculated before decoding. 
During decoding, we first infer the topic distribution
P (zf |d) for a given document on source language.
When applying a rule, it is straightforward to calcu-
late these topic features.  Obviously, the computa- 
tional cost of these features is rather small.
  In the topic-specific lexicon translation model, 
given a source document, it first calculates the topic- 
specific translation probability by normalizing the 
entire lexicon translation table, and then adapts the 
lexical weights of rules correspondingly. This makes 
the decoding slower. Therefore, comparing with the 
previous topic-specific lexicon translation method, 
our method provides a more efficient way for incor- 
porating topic model into SMT.

6    Experiments

We try to answer the following questions by experi- 
ments:

1. Is our topic similarity model able to improve 
translation quality in terms of BLEU? Further- 
more, are source-side and target-side rule-topic 
distributions complementary to each other?

  2 Since glue rule and rules of unknown words are not extract- 
ed from training data, here, we just ignore the calculation of the 
four features for them.

Table 2: Result of our topic similarity model in terms of BLEU and speed (words per second), comparing with the 
traditional hierarchical system (“Baseline”) and the topic-specific lexicon translation method (“TopicLex”). “SimSrc” 
and “SimTgt” denote similarity by source-side and target-side rule-distribution  respectively,  while “Sim+Sen” acti- 
vates the two similarity and two sensitivity features.  “Avg” is the average BL E U score on the two test sets.  Scores 
marked in bold mean significantly (Koehn, 2004) better than Baseline (p < 0.01).





2. Is it helpful  to introduce  the  topic  sensitivi- 
ty model to distinguish topic-insensitive and 
topic-sensitive rules?

3. Is it necessary to project topics by one-to-many 
correspondence instead of one-to-one corre- 
spondence?

4. What is the effect of our method on various 
types of rules, such as phrase rules and rules 
with non-terminals?

6.1    Data

We present our experiments on the NIST Chinese- 
English translation tasks. The bilingual training da- 
ta contains 239K sentence pairs with 6.9M Chinese 
words and 9.14M English words, which comes from 
the FBIS portion of LDC data.  There are 10,947 
documents in the FBIS corpus. The monolingual da- 
ta for training English language model includes the 
Xinhua portion of the GIGAWORD corpus, which 
contains 238M English words.  We used the NIST 
evaluation set of 2005 (MT05) as our development 
set, and sets of MT06/MT08 as test sets. The num- 
bers of documents in MT05, MT06, MT08 are 100,
79, and 109 respectively.
  We obtained symmetric word alignments of train- 
ing data by first running GIZA++  (Och and Ney,
2003) in both directions and then applying re- 
finement rule “grow-diag-final-and”  (Koehn et al.,
2003).    The  SCFG  rules  are  extracted  from  this 
word-aligned training data.   A 4-gram language 
model was trained on the monolingual data by the 
SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).   Case-insensitive 
NIST BLE U (Papineni et al., 2002) was used to mea-


sure translation performance. We used minimum er- 
ror rate training (Och, 2003) for optimizing the fea- 
ture weights.
  For the topic model, we used the open source L- 
DA tool GibbsLDA++ for estimation and inference.3
GibssLDA++ is an implementation of LDA using 
gibbs sampling for parameter estimation and infer- 
ence.  The source-side and target-side topic models 
are estimated from the Chinese part and English part 
of FBIS corpus respectively.  We set the number of 
topic K = 30 for both source-side and target-side, 
and use the default setting of the tool for training and 
inference.4   During decoding, we first infer the top- 
ic distribution of given documents before translation 
according to the topic model trained on Chinese part 
of FBIS corpus.

6.2    Effect of Topic Similarity Model

We compare our method with two baselines. In addi- 
tion to the traditional hiero system, we also compare 
with the topic-specific lexicon translation method in 
Zhao and Xing (2007). The lexicon translation prob- 
ability is adapted by:

p(f |e, DF ) ∝ p(e|f, DF )P (f |DF ) 	(6)
= ∑ p(e|f, z = k)p(f |z = k)p(z = k|DF )  (7)
k

However, we simplify the estimation of p(e|f, z  =
k) by directly using the word alignment corpus with

4 We determine K by testing {15, 30, 50, 100, 200} in our
preliminary  experiments.  We find that K = 30 produces a s-
lightly better performance than other values.

topic assignment that is inferred by the GibbsL- 
DA++. Despite the simplification of estimation, the 
improvement of our implementation is comparable 
with the improvement in Zhao et al.,(2007). Given a 
new document, we need to adapt the lexical transla- 
tion weights of the rules based on topic model. The 
adapted lexicon translation model is added as a new 
feature under the discriminative framework.
  Table 2 shows the result of our method compar- 
ing with the traditional system and the topic-lexicon 
specific translation method described as above.  By 
using all the features (last line in the table), we im- 
prove the translation performance over the baseline 
system by 0.87 BLEU point on average. Our method 
also outperforms the topic-lexicon specific transla- 
tion method by 0.47 points.  This verifies that topic 
similarity model can improve the translation quality 
significantly.
  In order to gain insights into why our model is 
helpful, we further investigate how many rules are 
topic-sensitive.  As described in Section 3.2, we use 
entropy to measure the topic sensitivity.  If the en- 
tropy of a rule is smaller than a certain threshold, 
then the rule is topic sensitive. Since documents of- 
ten focus on some topics, we use the average entropy 
of document-topic distribution of all training docu- 
ments as the threshold.   We compare both source- 
side and target-side distribution shown in Table 3. 
We find that more than 80 percents of the rules are 
topic-sensitive, thus provides us a large space to im- 
prove the translation by exploiting topics.
  We also compare these methods in terms of the 
decoding speed (words/second). The baseline trans- 
lates 12.6 words per second, while the topic-specific 
lexicon translation method only translates 3.3 word- 
s in one second.  The overhead of the topic-specific


Table 4: Effects of one-to-one and one-to-many topic pro-
jection.


lexicon translation method mainly comes from the 
adaptation  of lexical  weights.    It takes  72.8%  of 
the time to do the adaptation, despite only lexical 
weights of the used rules are adapted.  In contrast, 
our method has a speed of 10.2 words per second for 
each sentence on average, which is three times faster 
than the topic-specific lexicon translation method.
  Meanwhile,   we  try  to  separate  the  effects  of 
source-side topic distribution from the target-side 
topic distribution.  From lines 4-6 of Table 2.  We 
clearly find that the two rule-topic distributions im- 
prove  the  performance  by  0.48  and  0.38  BLE U 
points over the baseline respectively.  It seems that 
the source-side topic model is more helpful.  Fur- 
thermore, when combine these two distributions, the 
improvement is increased to 0.64 points. This indi- 
cates that the effects of source-side and target-side 
distributions are complementary.

6.3    Effect of Topic Sensitivity Model

As described in Section 3.2, because the similari- 
ty features always punish topic-insensitive rules, we 
introduce topic sensitivity features as a complemen- 
t.    In  the  last  line  of  Table  2,  we  obtain  a  fur- 
ther improvement of 0.23 points, when incorporat- 
ing topic sensitivity features with topic similarity 
features.  This suggests that it is necessary to dis- 
tinguish topic-insensitive and topic-sensitive rules.

6.4    One-to-One Vs. One-to-Many Topic
Projection

In Section 4.2, we find that source-side topic and 
target-side topics may not exactly match, hence we 
use one-to-many topic correspondence.  Yet anoth- 
er method is to enforce one-to-one topic projection 
(Tam et al., 2007). We achieve one-to-one projection 
by aligning a target topic to the source topic with the 
largest correspondence probability as calculated in 
Section 4.2.
Table 4 compares the effects of these two method-

s. We find that the enforced one-to-one topic method 
obtains a slight improvement over the baseline sys- 
tem, while one-to-many projection achieves a larger 
improvement.  This confirms our observation of the 
non-one-to-one mapping between source-side and 
target-side topics.

6.5    Effect on Various Types of Rules

To get a more detailed analysis of the result, we 
further compare the effect of our method on differ- 
ent types of rules.   We divide the rules into three 
types:  phrase rules,  which only contain terminal- 
s and are the same as the phrase pairs in phrase- 
based system; monotone rules, which contain non- 
terminals and produce monotone translations; re- 
ordering rules, which also contain non-terminals but 
change the order of translations.   We define the 
monotone and reordering rules according to Chiang 
et al., (2008).
  Table 5 show the results.  We can see that our 
method achieves improvements on all the three type- 
s of rules.   Our topic similarity method on mono- 
tone rule achieves the most improvement which is
0.6 BLE U points, while the improvement on reorder- 
ing rules is the smallest among the three types. This 
shows that topic information also helps the selec- 
tions of rules with non-terminals.

7    Related Work

In  addition  to  the  topic-specific  lexicon  transla- 
tion method mentioned in the previous sections, 
researchers also explore topic model for machine 
translation in other ways.
  Foster and Kunh (2007) describe a mixture-model 
approach for SMT adaptation.   They first split a 
training corpus into different domains.  Then, they 
train separate models on each domain. Finally, they



combine a specific domain translation model with a 
general domain translation model depending on var- 
ious text distances.  One way to calculate the dis- 
tance is using topic model.
  Gong et al.  (2010) introduce topic model for fil- 
tering topic-mismatched phrase pairs. They first as- 
sign a specific topic for the document to be translat- 
ed. Similarly, each phrase pair is also assigned with 
one specific topic. A phrase pair will be discarded if 
its topic mismatches the document topic.
  Researchers also introduce topic model for cross- 
lingual language model adaptation (Tam et al., 2007; 
Ruiz and Federico, 2011). They use bilingual topic 
model to project latent topic distribution across lan- 
guages. Based on the bilingual topic model, they ap- 
ply the source-side topic weights into the target-side 
topic model, and adapt the n-gram language model 
of target side.
  Our topic similarity model uses the document top- 
ic information.  From this point, our work is related 
to context-dependent  translation (Carpuat and Wu,
2007; He et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2009).  Previous 
work typically use neighboring words and sentence 
level information, while our work extents the con- 
text into the document level.


8    Conclusion and Future Work

We have presented a topic similarity model which 
incorporates the rule-topic distributions on both the 
source and target side into traditional hierarchical 
phrase-based system. Our experimental results show 
that our model achieves a better performance with 
faster decoding speed than previous work on topic- 
specific lexicon translation. This verifies the advan- 
tage of exploiting topic model at the rule level over 
the word level. Further improvement is achieved by 
distinguishing topic-sensitive and topic-insensitive 
rules using the topic sensitivity model.
  In the future, we are interesting to find ways to 
exploit topic model on bilingual data without docu- 
ment boundaries, thus to enlarge the size of training 
data. Furthermore, our training corpus mainly focus 
on news, it is also interesting to apply our method on 
corpus with more diverse topics. Finally, we hope to 
apply our method to other translation models, espe- 
cially syntax-based models.
