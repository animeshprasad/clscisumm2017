In this paper, the authors proposed a probabilistic admixture model to capture latent topics underlying the context of document- pairs. They proposed a new statistical formalism: Bilingual Topic AdMixture model, or BiTAM, to facilitate topic-based word alignment in SMT. They used IBM Model I as the baseline. They investigated three instances of the BiTAM model, They were data-driven and did not need handcrafted knowledge engineering. The proposed models signiÔ¨Åcantly improved the alignment accuracy and lead to better translation qualities. Incorporation of within-sentence dependencies such as the alignment-jumps and distortions, and a better treatment of the source monolingual model worth further investigations.
