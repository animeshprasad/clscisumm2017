<S sid ="0">BiTAM: Bilingual Topic AdMixture Models forWord Alignment</S>
<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">We propose a novel bilingual topical admixture (BiTAM) formalism for word alignment in statistical machine translation.</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">Under this formalism, the parallel sentence-pairs within a document-pair are assumed to constitute a mixture of hidden topics; each word-pair follows a topic-specific bilingual translation model.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">Three BiTAM models are proposed to capture topic sharing at different levels of linguistic granularity (i.e., at the sentence or word levels).</S>
<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">These models enable word- alignment process to leverage topical contents of document-pairs.</S>
<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Efficient variational approximation algorithms are designed for inference and parameter estimation.</S>
<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">With the inferred latent topics, BiTAM models facilitate coherent pairing of bilingual linguistic entities that share common topical aspects.</S>
<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Our preliminary experiments show that the proposed models improve word alignment accuracy, and lead to better translation quality.</S>
