This paper presents a hybrid method where two classes of methods have been used for resolving lexical ambiguity. The authors investigated the hypothesis that even better performance can be obtained by basing decisions on not just the single strongest piece of evidence, but on all available evidence. Their method combines context-word and collocation methods where the former captures the lexical "atmosphere", while the latter captures local syntax. The authors have used five methods for spelling correction: baseline, context words, collocations, decision list and Bayesian classifier. Decision list and Bayesian classifiers are their hybrid methods. For testing this method, confusion sets have been used with ambiguous words like desert and dessert, there and their etc. In their evaluation, they found that their hybrid Bayesian classifer outperforms the component methods as well as decision lists.
