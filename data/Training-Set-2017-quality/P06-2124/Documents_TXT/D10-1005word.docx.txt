Abstract

In this paper, we develop multilingual super- 
vised latent Dirichlet allocation (MLSLDA), 
a probabilistic generative model that allows 
insights gleaned from one language’s data to 
inform how the model captures properties of 
other languages. MLSLDA accomplishes this 
by jointly modeling two aspects of text: how 
multilingual concepts are clustered into themat- 
ically coherent topics and how topics associ- 
ated with text connect to an observed regres- 
sion variable (such as ratings on a sentiment 
scale). Concepts are represented in a general 
hierarchical framework that is flexible enough 
to express semantic ontologies, dictionaries, 
clustering  constraints, and, as a special, degen- 
erate case, conventional  topic models. Both 
the topics and the regression  are discovered 
via posterior inference from corpora. We show 
MLSLDA can build topics that are consistent 
across languages, discover sensible bilingual 
lexical  correspondences, and leverage multilin- 
gual corpora to better predict sentiment.

  Sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008) offers 
the promise of automatically discerning how people 
feel about a product, person, organization,  or issue 
based on what they write online, which  is potentially 
of great value to businesses and other organizations. 
However,  the vast majority of sentiment resources 
and algorithms are limited  to a single language, usu- 
ally English (Wilson, 2008; Baccianella and Sebas- 
tiani, 2010). Since no single  language captures a 
majority of the content online, adopting such a lim- 
ited approach in an increasingly global community 
risks missing important details and trends that might 
only be available when text in multiple  languages is 
taken into account.
  

Up to this point, multiple languages have been 
addressed in sentiment analysis primarily by 
trans- ferring knowledge from a resource-rich  
language to a less rich language (Banea et al., 
2008), or by ig- noring differences in languages 
via translation into English (Denecke, 2008). These 
approaches are lim- ited to a view of sentiment that 
takes place through an English-centric lens, and 
they ignore the poten- tial to share information 
between languages.  Ide- ally, learning sentiment 
cues holistically,  across lan- guages, would result 
in a richer and more globally consistent picture.

  In this paper, we introduce Multilingual Super- 
vised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (MLSLDA),  a 
model for sentiment analysis on a multilingual  cor- 
pus. MLSLDA discovers a consistent, unified picture 
of sentiment across multiple  languages by learning 
“topics,” probabilistic partitions of the vocabulary 
that are consistent in terms of both meaning and rel- 
evance to observed sentiment. Our approach makes 
few assumptions about available resources, requiring 
neither parallel corpora nor machine translation.

  The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Sec- 
tion 1, we describe the probabilistic  tools that we use 
to create consistent topics bridging  across languages 
and the MLSLDA model. In Section 2, we 
present the inference process. We discuss our set 
of seman- tic bridges between languages in Section 
3, and our experiments in Section 4 demonstrate 
that this ap- proach functions  as an effective 
multilingual topic model, discovers sentiment-
biased topics, and uses multilingual corpora to 
make better sentiment pre- dictions across 
languages. Sections 5 and 6 discuss related 
research and discusses future work, respec- tively.

1   Predictions from Multilingual  Topics

As its name suggests, MLSLDA is an extension of 
Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), 
a modeling  approach that takes a corpus  of unan- 
notated documents  as input and produces two out- 
puts, a set of “topics” and assignments of documents 
to topics. Both the topics and the assignments are 
probabilistic:  a topic is represented  as a probability 
distribution over words in the corpus, and each doc- 
ument is assigned a probability distribution over all 
the topics. Topic models built on the foundations of 
LDA are appealing for sentiment analysis because 
the learned topics can cluster together sentiment- 
bearing words, and because topic distributions  are a 
parsimonious way to represent a document.1
  LDA has been used to discover latent structure 
in text (e.g. for discourse segmentation (Purver et 
al., 2006) and authorship (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004)). 
MLSLDA extends the approach by ensuring that this 
latent structure — the underlying topics — is consis- 
tent across languages. We discuss multilingual topic 
modeling in Section 1.1, and in Section 1.2 we show 
how this enables supervised regression regardless of 
a document’s  language.

1.1   Capturing Semantic Correlations

Topic models posit a straightforward  generative pro- 
cess that creates an observed corpus. For each docu- 
ment d, some distribution  θd over unobserved topics 
is chosen. Then, for each word position in the doc- 
ument,  a topic z is selected.  Finally, the word for 
that position is generated by selecting from the topic 
indexed by z. (Recall that in LDA, a “topic” is a 
distribution over words).
  In monolingual topic models, the topic distribution 
is usually drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. Us- 
ing Dirichlet distributions  makes it easy to specify 
sparse priors,  and it also simplifies posterior infer- 
ence because Dirichlet distributions  are conjugate 
to multinomial distributions. However, drawing top- 
ics from Dirichlet distributions will  not suffice if 
our vocabulary includes multiple languages. If we 
are working with English, German, and Chinese at 
the same time, a Dirichlet prior has no way to fa-
vor distributions z such that p(good|z), p(gut|z), and

  1 The latter property has also made LDA popular for infor- 
mation retrieval (Wei and Croft, 2006)).


p(haˇo|z) all tend to be high at the same time, or low
at the same time. More generally,  the structure of our
model must encourage topics to be consistent across 
languages, and Dirichlet distributions cannot encode 
correlations between elements.
  One possible solution to this problem is to use the 
multivariate normal distribution, which can produce 
correlated multinomials  (Blei and Lafferty, 2005), 
in place of the Dirichlet distribution. This has been 
done successfully  in multilingual settings (Cohen 
and Smith, 2009). However, such models complicate 
inference by not being conjugate.
  Instead, we appeal to tree-based extensions of the 
Dirichlet distribution, which has been used to induce 
correlation in semantic ontologies (Boyd-Graber et 
al., 2007) and to encode clustering constraints (An- 
drzejewski et al., 2009). The key idea in this ap- 
proach is to assume the vocabularies of all languages 
are organized according  to some shared semantic 
structure that can be represented as a tree. For con- 
creteness in this section, we will use WordNet (Miller,
1990) as the representation of this multilingual se- 
mantic bridge, since it is well known, offers conve- 
nient and intuitive terminology,  and demonstrates the 
full flexibility of our approach. However, the model 
we describe generalizes to any tree-structured rep- 
resentation of multilingual knowledge; we discuss 
some alternatives in Section 3.
   WordNet organizes a vocabulary into a rooted, di- 
rected acyclic graph of nodes called synsets, short for 
“synonym sets.” A synset is a child of another synset 
if it satisfies a hyponomy  relationship;  each child “is 
a” more specific instantiation of its parent concept 
(thus, hyponomy is often called an “isa” relationship). 
For example, a “dog” is a “canine”  is an “animal” is
a “living thing,” etc. As an approximation,  it is not 
unreasonable to assume that WordNet’s structure of 
meaning is language independent, i.e. the concept 
encoded by a synset can be realized using terms in 
different  languages that share the same meaning. In 
practice, this organization  has been used to create 
many alignments of international WordNets to the 
original English WordNet (Ordan and Wintner, 2007; 
Sagot and Fisˇer, 2008; Isahara et al., 2008).
  Using the structure of WordNet, we can now de- 
scribe a generative process that produces a distribu- 
tion over a multilingual vocabulary, which encour- 
ages correlations between words with similar mean-


ings regardless of what language each word is in. 
For each synset h, we create a multilingual word 
distribution for that synset as follows:
1. Draw transition probabilities βh  ∼ Dir (τh )
2. Draw stop probabilities ωh  ∼ Dir (κh )
3. For each language l, draw emission probabilities for 
that synset φh,l  ∼ Dir (πh,l ).

For conciseness in the rest of the paper, we will refer 
to this generative  process as multilingual Dirichlet 
hierarchy, or MULTDIRHIER(τ , κ, π).2  Each ob- 
served token can be viewed  as the end result of a 
sequence of visited synsets λ. At each node in the 
tree, the path can end at node i with probability ωi,1, 
or it can continue to a child synset with probability 
ωi,0. If the path continues to another child synset, it 
visits child j with probability βi,j . If the path ends at 
a synset, it generates word k with probability φi,l,k .3
The probability of a word being emitted from a path 
with visited synsets r and final synset h in language 
l is therefore
p(w, λ = r, h|l, β, ω, φ) =
	
 n βi,j ωi,0 (1 − ωh,1)φh,l,w .	(1)
(i,j)∈r

Note that the stop probability  ωh is independent of 
language, but the emission φh,l is dependent on the 
language. This is done to prevent the following sce- 
nario: while synset A is highly probable in a topic 
and words in language 1 attached to that synset have 
high probability, words in language 2 have low prob- 
ability.  If this could happen for many synsets in 
a topic, an entire language would be effectively  si- 
lenced, which would lead to inconsistent topics (e.g.

  2 Variables τh , πh,l , and κh are hyperparameters. Their mean 
is fixed, but their magnitude is sampled during inference (i.e.
τh,i


Topic 1 is about baseball in English and about travel 
in German). Separating path from emission helps 
ensure that topics are consistent across languages.
  Having defined topic distributions in a way that can 
preserve cross-language correspondences, we now 
use this distribution within a larger model that can 
discover cross-language patterns of use that predict 
sentiment.

1.2   The MLSLDA Model

We will view sentiment analysis as a regression prob- 
lem: given an input document, we want to predict 
a real-valued observation y that represents the senti- 
ment of a document. Specifically, we build on super- 
vised latent Dirichlet allocation (SLDA, (Blei and 
McAuliffe, 2007)), which makes predictions based 
on the topics expressed in a document;  this can be 
thought of projecting the words in a document to low 
dimensional  space of dimension equal to the number 
of topics. Blei et al. showed that using this latent 
topic structure can offer improved predictions over re- 
gressions based on words alone, and the approach fits 
well with our current goals, since word-level cues are 
unlikely to be identical  across languages. In addition 
to text, SLDA  has been successfully applied to other 
domains such as social networks  (Chang and Blei,
2009) and image classification (Wang et al., 2009). 
The key innovation in this paper is to extend SLDA 
by creating topics that are globally consistent across 
languages, using the bridging  approach above.
  We express our model in the form of a probabilis- 
tic generative latent-variable model that generates 
documents in multiple languages and assigns a real- 
valued score to each document.   The score comes 
from a normal distribution  whose sum is the dot prod- 
uct between a regression parameter η that encodes 
the influence of each topic on the observation and

(e.g. dictionary and flat), their mean is uniform. For GermaNet,
we took frequencies from two balanced corpora of German and
English: the British National Corpus (University of Oxford,
2006) and the Kern Corpus of the Digitales Wo¨ rterbuch der 
Deutschen Sprache des 20. Jahrhunderts project (Geyken, 2007). 
We took these frequencies  and propagated them through the 
multilingual hierarchy, following LDAWN’s (Boyd-Graber et 
al., 2007) formulation of information content (Resnik, 1995) as 
a Bayesian prior. The variance of the priors was initialized  to be
1.0, but could be sampled during inference.
     3 Note that the language and word are taken as given, but the 
path through the semantic hierarchy is a latent random variable.


tistical inference to determine the distribution over 
latent variables that, given the model, best explains 
observed data.
The generative model is as follows:

1. For each topic i = 1 . . . K , draw a topic distribution
{βi , ωi , φi } from MULTDIRHIER(τ , κ, π).
2. For each document d = 1 . . . M with language ld : 
(a) Choose a  distribution over topics θd	∼
Dir (α).



(b) For each word in the document n = 1 . . . Nd , 
choose a topic assignment zd,n   ∼ Mult (θd )
and a path λd,n ending at word wd,n  according 
to Equation 1 using {βzd,n , ωzd,n , φzd,n }.

  Crucially, note that the topics are not indepen-

2   Inference

Finding the model parameters most likely to explain 
the data is a problem  of statistical inference. We em- 
ploy stochastic EM (Diebolt and Ip, 1996), using a 
Gibbs sampler for the E-step to assign words to paths 
and topics. After randomly initializing the topics, 
we alternate between sampling the topic and path

p(zn = k|z−n, α). 	(2)

Each of these three terms reflects a different influence 
on the topics from the vocabulary structure, the doc- 
ument’s topics, and the response variable.  In the next 
paragraphs, we will expand each of them to derive 
the full conditional topic distribution.
  As discussed in Section 1.1, the structure of the 
topic distribution  encourages terms with the same 
meaning to be in the same topic, even across lan- 
guages. During inference, we marginalize over pos- 
sible multinomial distributions β, ω, and φ, using 
the observed transitions from i to j in topic k; Tk,i,j , 
stop counts in synset i in topic k, Ok,i,0; continue 
counts in synsets i in topic k, Ok,i,1; and emission 
counts in synset i in language l in topic k, Fk,i,l . The

Equation 3 reflects the multilingual aspect of 
this model.    The conditional topic 
distribution for SLDA (Blei and McAuliffe, 
2007) replaces this term with the standard 
Multinomial-Dirichlet. However, we believe 
this is the first published SLDA-style model 
using MCMC inference,  as prior work has used 
variational  inference (Blei  and McAuliffe, 2007; 
Chang and Blei, 2009; Wang et al., 2009).
  Because the observed response variable 
depends on the topic assignments of a document, 
the condi- tional topic distribution is shifted 
toward topics that explain the observed response. 
Topics that move the predicted response yˆd  
toward the true yd will be fa- vored. We drop 
terms that are constant across all


topics for the effect of the response variable,

p(yd|z, η, σ) ∝

words in all languages associated with that node. This 
is consistent with our model, but there is really no 
shared semantic  space, as all emitted words must 
come from this degenerate “synset”  and the model 
only represents the output distribution for this single 
node.

This term represents the document focus of this
model; it is present in all Gibbs sampling inference 
schemes for LDA (Griffiths  and Steyvers, 2004).
  Multiplying together Equations 3, 4, and 5 allows 
us to sample a topic using the conditional  distribution 
from Equation  2, based on the topic and path of the 
other words in all languages.  After sampling the 
path and topic for each word in a document, we then 
find new regression parameters η that maximize the 
likelihood conditioned on the current  state of the 
sampler.  This is simply a least squares regression 
using the topic assignments z¯d to predict yd.
Prediction on documents for which we don’t have
an observed yd is equivalent to marginalizing over 
yd and sampling topics for the document from Equa- 
tions 3 and 5. The prediction for yd is then the dot 
product of η and the empirical topic distribution  z¯d.
  We initially optimized all hyperparameters using 
slice sampling. However, we found that the regres- 
sion variance σ2 was not stable. Optimizing σ2 seems 
to balance between modeling the language in the doc- 
uments and the prediction,  and thus is sensitive to 
documents’ length. Given this sensitivity, we did 
not optimize σ2 for our prediction experiments in 
Section 4, but instead kept it fixed at 0.25. We leave 
optimizing  this variable, either through cross valida- 
tion or adapting the model, to future work.


moved all synsets that were had no mapped German 
words. Any German synsets that did not have English 
translations had their words mapped to the lowest 
extant English hypernym (e.g. “beinbruch,” a bro- 
ken leg, was mapped to “fracture”). We stemmed 
all words to account for inflected forms not being 
present (Porter and Boulton, 1970). An example 
of the paths for the German word “wunsch” (wish, 
request) is shown in Figure 2(a).

Dictionaries A dictionary  can be viewed as a many 
to many mapping,  where each entry ei  maps one 
or more words in one language si  to one or more 
words ti in another language.  Entries were taken 
from an English-German dictionary (Richter, 2008) 
a Chinese-English  dictionary  (Denisowski,  1997), 
and a Chinese-German dictionary  (Hefti, 2005). As 
with WordNet, the words in entries for English and 
German were stemmed to improve coverage. An 
example for German is shown in Figure 2(b).

Algorithmic  Connections   In addition to hand- 
curated connections across languages, one could also 
consider automatic means of mapping  across lan- 
guages,  such  as using edit distance or local con- 
text (Haghighi et al., 2008; Rapp, 1995) or us- 
ing a lexical translation table obtained from paral- 
lel text (Melamed, 1998). While we experimented

with these techniques, constructing appropriate hier- 
archies from these resources required many arbitrary 
decisions about cutoffs and which words to include. 
Thus, we do not consider them in this paper.

4   Experiments

We evaluate MLSLDA on three criteria: how well 
it can discover  consistent topics across languages 
for matching parallel documents, how well it can 
discover sentiment-correlated word lists from non- 
aligned text, and how well it can predict sentiment.

4.1   Matching on Multilingual  Topics

We took the 1996 documents from the Europarl cor- 
pus (Koehn, 2005) using three bridges: GermaNet, 
dictionary, and the uninformative flat matching.4  The 
model is unaware that the translations of documents 
in one language are present in the other language. 
Note that this does not use the supervised framework

(as there is no associated response variable for Eu- 
roparl documents); this experiment is to demonstrate 
the effectiveness of the multilingual aspect of the 
model. To test whether the topics learned by the 
model are consistent across languages, we represent 
each document using the probability distribution θd 
over topic assignments. Each θd is a vector of length 
K and is a language-independent  representation of 
the document.
  For each document in one language, we computed 
the Hellinger distance between it and all of the docu- 
ments in the other language and sorted the documents 
by decreasing distance. The translation of the docu- 
ment is somewhere in that set; the higher the normal- 
ized rank (the percentage of documents with a rank 
lower than the translation of the document), the better 
the underlying  topic model connects languages.
  We compare three bridges against what is to our 
knowledge the only other topic model for unaligned 
text, Multilingual Topics for Unaligned Text (Boyd- 
Graber and Blei, 2009).5


we  removed  stop  words  (Loper  and  Bird,  2002),  stemmed	 	


words (Porter and Boulton, 1970), and created a vocabulary 
of the most frequent 5000 words per language (this vocabulary 
limit was mostly done to ensure that the dictionary-based  bridge 
was of manageable size). Documents shorter than fifty content 
words were excluded.
  

5 The bipartite matching was initialized with the dictionary 
weights as specified by the Multilingual Topics for Unaligned 
Text algorithm.  The matching size was limited to 250 and the 
bipartite matching was only updated on the initial iteration then 
held fixed. This yielded results comparable to when the matching

  Figure 3 shows the results of this experiment. The 
dictionary-based bridge had the best performance on 
the task, ranking  a large proportion  of documents 
(0.95) below the translated document once enough 
topics were available. Although GermaNet is richer, 
its coverage is incomplete; the dictionary structure 
had a much larger vocabulary and could build a more 
complete multilingual  topics. Using comparable in- 
put information, this more flexible model performed 
better on the matching task than the existing multi- 
lingual topic model available for unaligned text. The 
degenerate flat bridge did no better than the baseline 
of random guessing, as expected.

4.2   Qualitative Sentiment-Correlated Topics

One of the key tasks in sentiment analysis has been 
the collection of lists of words that convey senti- 
ment (Wilson, 2008; Riloff et al., 2003).  These 
resources are often created using or in reference 
to resources like WordNet (Whitelaw et al., 2005; 
Baccianella and Sebastiani, 2010). MLSLDA pro- 
vides a method for extracting topical and sentiment- 
correlated word lists from multilingual corpora. If

content bearing topics. For example; in the German-
English corpus, “food” and “children” topics are 
not associated with a consistent  sentiment  signal, 
while “religion” is associated with a more negative 
sentiment. In contrast, in the German-Chinese cor- 
pus, the “religion/society” topic is more neutral, and 
the gender-oriented topic is viewed more negatively. 
Negative sentiment-bearing topics have reasonable 
words such as “pages,” “koˇ ng pa`” (Chinese for “I’m 
afraid that . . . ”) and “tuo” (Chienese for “discard”), 
and positive sentiment-bearing topics have reason- 
able words  such as “great,” “good,” and “juwel” (Ger- 
man for “jewel”).
  The qualitative topics also betray some of the 
weaknesses of the model. For example, in one of 
the negative sentiment topics, the German word “gut” 
(good) is present.  Because topics are distributions 
over words, they can encode the presence of nega- 
tions like “kein” (no) and “nicht” (not), but not collo- 
cations like “nicht gut.” More elaborate topic models 
that can model local syntax and collocations (John- 
son, 2010) provide options for addressing such prob- 
lems.
  We do not report the results for sentiment predic- 
tion for this corpus because the baseline of predicting 
a positive review is so strong; most algorithms do ex- 
tremely well by always predicting a positive review, 
ours included.

4.3   Sentiment Prediction

review site (Vetter et al., 2000) and combined them 
with a much larger English film review corpus of over

discussing the number of pages have negative regression parameters, topics with “good,” “great,” “haˇo” (good) and 
“u¨ berzeugt” (convinced)  have positive regression parameters. For the German-Chinese corpus, note the presence of “gut” 
(good) in one of the negative sentiment topics, showing the difficulty of learning collocations.


prevent over-fitting.







Table 1: Mean squared error on a film review corpus. 
All results are on the same German test data, varying  the 
training data. Over-fitting  prevents the model learning on 
the German data alone; adding English data to the mix 
allows the model to make better predictions.


5000 film reviews (Pang and Lee, 2005) to create a 
multilingual film review corpus.6
  The results for predicting sentiment in German 
documents with 25 topics are presented in Table 1. 
On a small monolingual  corpus, prediction is very 
poor. The model over-fits, especially when it has 
the entire vocabulary to select from. The slightly 
better performance using GermaNet and a dictionary 
as topic priors can be viewed as basic feature selec- 
tion, removing proper names from the vocabulary to

  6 We followed Pang and Lee’s method for creating  a nu- 
merical score between  0 and 1 from a  star rating.   We 
then converted  that to an integer by multiplying by 100; 
this was  done because  initial  data preprocessing  assumed 
integer values (although  downstream processing did not as- 
sume integer values).  The German  movie review corpus 
is available at http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/˜jbg/ 
static/downloads_and_media.html
  

One would expect that prediction improves with a 
larger training set. For this model, such an improve- 
ment is seen even when the training  set includes no 
documents in the target language. Note that even the 
degenerate flat bridge across languages provides use- 
ful information. After introducing English data, the 
model learns to prefer smaller regression parameters 
(this can be seen as a form  of regularization).


  Performance is best when a reasonably large cor- 
pus is available including some data in the target 
language.  For each bridge, performance improves 
dramatically, showing that MLSLDA is successfully 
able to incorporate information  learned from both 
languages to build a single, coherent picture of how 
sentiment is expressed in both languages. With the 
GermaNet bridge, performance is better than both 
the degenerate and dictionary based bridges, showing 
that the model is sharing information both through 
the multilingual topics and the regression parameters. 
Performance on English prediction is comparable 
to previously  published results on this dataset (Blei 
and McAuliffe, 2007); with enough data, a monolin- 
gual model is no longer helped by adding additional 
multilingual data.


5   Relationship to Previous Research

The advantages of MLSLDA reside largely in the 
assumptions that it makes and does not make: docu- 
ments need not be parallel, sentiment is a normally 
distributed document-level property, words are ex- 
changeable, and sentiment can be predicted  as a re- 
gression on a K-dimensional  vector.
  By not assuming parallel text, this approach can 
be applied to a broad class of corpora. Other mul- 
tilingual topic models require parallel text, either at 
the document (Ni et al., 2009; Mimno et al., 2009) 
or word-level (Kim and Khudanpur, 2004; Zhao and 
Xing, 2006). Similarly, other multilingual sentiment 
approaches also require parallel text, often supplied 
via automatic translation; after the translated text 
is available, either monolingual analysis (Denecke,
2008) or co-training is applied (Wan, 2009). In con- 
trast, our approach requires fewer resources for a lan- 
guage: a dictionary  (or similar knowledge structure 
relating words to nodes in a graph) and comparable 
text, instead of parallel text or a machine translation 
system.
  Rather than viewing one language through the 
lens of another language, MLSLDA views all lan- 
guages through the lens of the topics present in a 
document. This is a modeling  decision with pros and 
cons. It allows a language agnostic decision about 
sentiment to be made, but it restricts the expressive- 
ness of the model in terms of sentiment in two ways. 
First, it throws away information important to sen- 
timent analysis like syntactic constructions (Greene 
and Resnik, 2009) and document structure (McDon- 
ald et al., 2007) that may impact the sentiment rating. 
Second, a single real number is not always sufficient 
to capture the nuances of sentiment. Less critically, 
assuming that sentiment is normally distributed is not 
true of all real-world corpora; review corpora often 
have a skew toward positive reviews. We standardize 
responses by the mean and variance of the training 
data to partially  address this issue, but other response 
distributions are possible, such as generalized linear 
models (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007) and vector ma- 
chines (Zhu et al., 2009), which would allow more 
traditional classification predictions.
  Other probabilistic models for sentiment classifi- 
cation view  sentiment as a word level feature. Some 
models  use sentiment  word lists, either given or


learned from a corpus,  as a prior to seed topics so 
that they attract other sentiment bearing words (Mei 
et al., 2007; Lin and He, 2009). Other approaches 
view sentiment or perspective  as a perturbation  of 
a log-linear topic model (Lin et al., 2008). Such 
techniques could be combined with the multilingual 
approach presented here by using distributions over 
words that not only bridge different languages but 
also encode additional information.  For example, the 
vocabulary hierarchies could be structured to encour- 
age topics that encourage correlation  among similar 
sentiment-bearing words (e.g. clustering words asso- 
ciated with price, size, etc.). Future work could also 
more rigorously validate that the multilingual  topics 
discovered by MLSLDA are sentiment-bearing  via 
human judgments.
  In contrast, MLSLDA draws on techniques that 
view sentiment as a regression problem  based on the 
topics used in a document,  as in supervised latent 
Dirichlet allocation (SLDA) (Blei and McAuliffe,
2007) or in finer-grained parts of a document (Titov 
and McDonald,  2008). Extending these models to 
multilingual data would be more straightforward.

6   Conclusions

MLSLDA is a “holistic” statistical model for multi- 
lingual corpora that does not require parallel text 
or expensive multilingual resources.   It discovers 
connections  across languages that can recover la- 
tent structure in parallel corpora, discover sentiment- 
correlated word lists in multiple  languages, and make 
accurate predictions across languages that improve 
with more multilingual data, as demonstrated  in the 
context of sentiment analysis.
  More generally, MLSLDA provides a formalism 
that can be used to incorporate the many insights of 
topic modeling-driven  sentiment analysis to multi- 
lingual corpora by tying together word distributions 
across languages. MLSLDA can also contribute to 
the development of word list-based sentiment sys- 
tems: the topics discovered by MLSLDA can serve 
as a first-pass  means of sentiment-based word lists 
for languages that might lack annotated resources.
  MLSLDA  also can be viewed as a sentiment- 
informed multilingual word sense disambiguation 
(WSD) algorithm. When the multilingual  bridge is an 
explicit representation of sense such as WordNet, part


of the generative process is an explicit assignment 
of every word to sense (the path latent variable  λ); 
this is discovered during inference. The dictionary- 
based technique may be viewed as a disambiguation 
via a transfer dictionary.  How sentiment prediction 
impacts the implicit WSD is left to future work.
  Better capturing local syntax and meaningful col- 
locations would also improve the model’s ability to 
predict sentiment and model multilingual  topics, as 
would providing  a better mechanism for represent- 
ing words not included in our bridges. We intend to 
develop such models as future work.
