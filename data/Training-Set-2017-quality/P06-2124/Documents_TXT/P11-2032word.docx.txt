Abstract

In this work, we compare the translation 
performance  of  word alignments obtained 
via Bayesian inference to those obtained via 
expectation-maximization (EM). We propose 
a Gibbs sampler for fully Bayesian inference 
in IBM Model 1, integrating over all possi- 
ble parameter values in finding the alignment 
distribution.  We show that Bayesian inference 
outperforms EM in all of the tested language 
pairs, domains and data set sizes, by up to 2.99
BLEU points. We also show that the proposed 
method effectively addresses the well-known 
rare word problem in EM-estimated models; 
and at the same time induces a much smaller 
dictionary of bilingual word-pairs.


1   Introduction

Word alignment is a crucial early step in the training 
of most statistical machine translation (SMT) sys- 
tems, in which the estimated alignments are used for 
constraining  the set of candidates in phrase/grammar 
extraction (Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2007; Galley 
et al., 2006). State-of-the-art word alignment mod- 
els, such as IBM Models (Brown et al., 1993), HMM 
(Vogel et al., 1996), and the jointly-trained symmet- 
ric HMM (Liang et al., 2006), contain a large num- 
ber of parameters (e.g., word translation probabili- 
ties) that need to be estimated in addition to the de- 
sired hidden alignment variables.
  The most common method of inference in such 
models is expectation-maximization (EM) (Demp- 
ster et al., 1977) or an approximation  to EM when 
exact EM is intractable. However,  being  a maxi-


mization (e.g., maximum likelihood (ML) or max- 
imum a posteriori (MAP)) technique, EM is gen- 
erally prone to local optima and overfitting.  In 
essence, the alignment distribution obtained via EM 
takes into account only the most likely point in the 
parameter space, but does not consider contributions 
from other points.
  Problems  with the standard  EM estimation  of 
IBM Model 1 was pointed out by Moore (2004) and 
a number of heuristic changes to the estimation pro- 
cedure, such as smoothing  the parameter estimates, 
were shown to reduce the alignment error rate, but 
the effects on translation performance was not re- 
ported.  Zhao and Xing (2006) note that the param- 
eter estimation (for which they use variational EM) 
suffers from data sparsity and use symmetric  Dirich- 
let priors, but they find the MAP solution.
  Bayesian inference,  the approach in this paper, 
have recently been applied to several unsupervised 
learning problems in NLP (Goldwater and Griffiths,
2007; Johnson et al., 2007) as well as to other tasks 
in SMT such as synchronous grammar induction 
(Blunsom et al., 2009) and learning  phrase align- 
ments directly (DeNero et al., 2008).
  Word alignment learning problem was addressed 
jointly  with  segmentation  learning in  Xu  et al. 
(2008), Nguyen et al. (2010), and Chung and Gildea 
(2009). The former two works place nonparametric 
priors (also known as cache models) on the param- 
eters and utilize Gibbs sampling. However, align- 
ment inference in neither of these works is exactly 
Bayesian since the alignments  are updated by run- 
ning GIZA++ (Xu et al., 2008) or by local maxi- 
mization (Nguyen et al., 2010). On the other hand,

Chung and Gildea (2009) apply a sparse Dirichlet 
prior on the multinomial parameters to prevent over- 
fitting. They use variational Bayes for inference, but 
they do not investigate the effect of Bayesian infer- 
ence to word alignment in isolation. Recently, Zhao 
and Gildea (2010) proposed fertility extensions to 
IBM Model 1 and HMM, but they do not place any 
prior on the parameters and their inference method is 
actually stochastic EM (also known as Monte Carlo 
EM), a ML technique in which sampling is used to

knowledge, this is the first work to directly investi- 
gate the effects of Bayesian alignment inference on 
translation performance.

2   Bayesian Inference with IBM Model 1

Given a sentence-aligned parallel corpus (E, F), let 
ei  (fj ) denote the i-th (j-th) source (target)1  word 
in e (f ), which in turn consists of I (J ) words and 
denotes the s-th sentence in E (F).2   Each source 
sentence is also hypothesized to have an additional 
imaginary “null” word e0. Also let VE (VF ) denote 
the size of the observed source (target) vocabulary.
In Model 1 (Brown  et al., 1993), each target word

  1 We use the “source”  and “target” labels following the gen- 
erative process, in which E generates F (cf. Eq. 1).

where in (3) the count variable ne,f   denotes  the 
number of times the source word type e is aligned 
to the target word type f in the sentence-pair s, and
in (4) Ne,f   = L.s  ne,f . Since the distribution  over
{te,f } in (4) is in the exponential family, specifically
being a multinomial distribution, we choose the con-
jugate prior, in this case the Dirichlet distribution, 
for computational convenience.
  For each source word type e, we assume the prior 
distribution for te   = te,1 · · · te,VF , which is itself
a  distribution over the target vocabulary,  to be a

Dirichlet distribution (with its own set of hyperpa- 
rameters Θe  = θe,1 · · · θe,VF ) independent from the
priors of other source word types:

te  ∼ Dirichlet(te; Θe)
fj |a, e, T ∼ Multinomial(fj ; teaj )

  We choose symmetric Dirichlet  priors identically 
for all source words e with θe,f   = θ = 0.0001 to 
obtain a sparse Dirichlet prior. A sparse prior  favors

where Θ = Θ1 · · · ΘVE .
To infer the posterior distribution of the align-
ments,  we use  Gibbs sampling  (Geman and Ge- 
man, 1984). One possible method is to derive the 
Gibbs sampler from P (E, F, A, T; Θ) obtained in 
(5) and sample the unknowns A and T in turn, re- 
sulting in an explicit Gibbs sampler.  In this work, 
we marginalize out T by:

For Turkish↔English   experiments,  we used  the
20K-sentence travel domain BTEC dataset (Kikui
et al., 2006) from the yearly IWSLT evaluations6 
for training,  the CSTAR  2003 test set for develop- 
ment, and the IWSLT 2004 test set for testing7. For
Czech↔English, we used the 95K-sentence news

and obtain a collapsed  Gibbs sampler, which sam- 
ples only the alignment variables.
  Using P (E, F, A; Θ) obtained in (6), the Gibbs 
sampling formula for the individual alignments is 
derived as:4

news2009  set for testing, and the 438M-word En- 
glish and 81.7M-word  Czech monolingual news cor- 
pora for additional language model (LM) training.
For Arabic↔English,  we used  the 65K-sentence
LDC2004T18  (news from 2001-2004) for training,

where the superscript j  denotes the exclusion of
the current value of aj .
  The algorithm is given in Table 1. Initialization 
of A in Step 1 can be arbitrary, but for faster conver- 
gence special initializations have been used, e.g., us- 
ing the output of EM (Chiang et al., 2010). Once the 
Gibbs sampler is deemed to have converged after B 
burn-in iterations, we collect M samples of A with
L iterations in-between5 to estimate P (A|E, F). To
obtain the Viterbi alignments, which are required for
phrase extraction (Koehn et al., 2003), we select for 
each aj  the most frequent value in the M collected 
samples.

  4 The derivation is quite standard  and similar to other 
Dirichlet-multinomial Gibbs sampler derivations, e.g. (Resnik 
and Hardisty, 2010).

guage models are 4-gram in the travel domain exper- 
iments and 5-gram in the news domain experiments.
  For each  language  pair,  we trained standard 
phrase-based SMT systems in both directions (in- 
cluding alignment  symmetrization  and log-linear 
model tuning) using Moses (Koehn  et al., 2007), 
SRILM  (Stolcke,   2002), and ZMERT (Zaidan,

GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) for EM.
  For each translation  task, we report two EM es- 
timates, obtained after 5 and 80 iterations (EM-5 
and EM-80), respectively; and three Gibbs sampling 
estimates, two of which were initialized with those 
two EM Viterbi alignments (GS-5 and GS-80) and a 
third was initialized naively9 (GS-N). Sampling set-
tings were B = 400 for T↔E, 4000 for C↔E and
8000 for A↔E; M  = 100, and L = 10. For refer-
ence, we also report the results with IBM Model 4
alignments (M4) trained in the standard bootstrap- 
ping regimen of 15H 53343.

4   Results

Table 2 compares the BLEU scores of Bayesian in- 
ference and EM estimation. In all translation tasks, 
Bayesian inference outperforms EM. The improve- 
ment range is from 2.59 (in Turkish-to-English) 
up to 2.99 (in English-to-Turkish) BLEU points in 
travel domain and from 0.16 (in English-to-Czech) 
up to 0.85 (in English-to-Arabic) BLEU points in 
news domain. Compared to the state-of-the-art IBM 
Model 4, the Bayesian Model 1 is better in all travel 
domain tasks and is comparable or better in the news 
domain.
  Fertility of a source word is defined  as the num- 
ber of target words aligned to it. Table 3 shows the 
distribution of fertilities in alignments obtained from 
different methods. Compared to EM estimation, in- 
cluding Model 4, the proposed Bayesian inference 
dramatically  reduces “questionable” high-fertility (4
≤ fertility ≤ 7) alignments and almost entirely elim-

The four blocks of rows from top to bottom correspond 
to (in order) the total number of source tokens, source 
tokens with fertilities in the range 4–7, source tokens

observed fertility. The first language listed is the source

The number of distinct word-pairs induced by an
alignment has been recently proposed as an objec- 
tive function for word alignment (Bodrumlu et 
al.,
2009).  Small dictionary  sizes are preferred  
over large ones. Table 4 shows that the 
proposed in- ference method substantially  reduces 
the alignment dictionary size, in most cases by 
more than 50%.

5   Conclusion

We developed a Gibbs sampling-based Bayesian in- 
ference method for IBM Model 1 word alignments 
and showed that it outperforms EM estimation in 
terms of translation BLEU scores across several 
lan- guage pairs,  data sizes and domains. As a 
result of this increase, Bayesian Model 1 
alignments per- form close to or better than the 
state-of-the-art IBM


9 Each target word was aligned to the source candidate that	 	


co-occured the most number of times with that target word in 
the entire parallel corpus.
  

10 The GIZA++ implementation of Model 4 artificially limits 
fertility parameter values to at most nine.


Model 4. The proposed method learns a compact, 
sparse translation distribution, overcoming the well- 
known “garbage collection”  problem of rare words 
in EM-estimated current models.
