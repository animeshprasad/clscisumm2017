<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">To investigate the influence of these factors, we analyze Modern Standard Arabic (henceforth MSA, or simply “Arabic”) because of the unusual opportunity it presents for comparison to English parsing results.</S>
<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">The Penn Arabic Treebank (ATB) syntactic guidelines (Maamouri et al., 2004) were purposefully borrowed without major modification from English (Marcus et al., 1993).</S>
<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">Next we show that the ATB is similar to other tree- banks in gross statistical terms, but that annotation consistency remains low relative to English (§3).</S>
<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">We then use linguistic and annotation insights to develop a manually annotated grammar for Arabic (§4).</S>
<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">Finally, we provide a realistic eval uation in which segmentation is performed both in a pipeline and jointly with parsing (Â§6).</S>

<S sid ="64" ssid = "38">We propose a limit of 70 words for Arabic parsing evaluations.</S>
<S sid ="72" ssid = "46">We show that noun-noun vs. discourse-level coordination ambiguity in Arabic is a significant source of parsing errors (Table 8c).</S>
<S sid ="116" ssid = "4">In our grammar, features are realized as annotations to basic category labels.</S>
<S sid ="117" ssid = "5">We start with noun features since written Arabic contains a very high proportion of NPs.</S>
<S sid ="128" ssid = "16">8 We use head-finding rules specified by a native speaker.</S>
<S sid ="141" ssid = "8">mark- ContainsVerb is especially effective for distinguishing root S nodes of equational sentences.</S>
<S sid ="153" ssid = "20">Preprocessing the raw trees improves parsing performance considerably.9 We first discard all trees dominated by X, which indicates errors and non-linguistic text.</S>
<S sid ="154" ssid = "21">At the phrasal level, we remove all function tags and traces.</S>

<S sid ="270" ssid = "63">6 Joint Segmentation and Parsing.</S>
<S sid ="275" ssid = "68">But gold segmentation is not available in application settings, so a segmenter and parser are arranged in a pipeline.</S>
<S sid ="277" ssid = "70">Lattice parsing (Chappelier et al., 1999) is an alternative to a pipeline that prevents cascading errors by placing all segmentation options into the parse chart.</S>
<S sid ="279" ssid = "72">We extend the Stanford parser to accept pre-generated lattices, where each word is represented as a finite state automaton.</S>
