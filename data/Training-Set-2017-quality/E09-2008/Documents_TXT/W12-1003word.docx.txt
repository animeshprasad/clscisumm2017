Abstract


We  present work on a  verse-composition 
assistant for composing, checking correct- 
ness  of,  and singing traditional Basque 
bertsoak—impromptu  verses on particular 
themes.  A performing bertsolari—a verse 
singer in the Basque Country—must  ad- 
here to strict rules that dictate the format 
and content of the verses  sung. To help 
the aspiring bertsolari, we provide  a tool 
that includes  a web interface that is able 
to analyze, correct, provide suggestions and 
synonyms, and tentatively also sing (using 
text-to-speech synthesis) verses composed 
by the user.



1   Introduction

In  the Basque Country there exists   a  long- 
standing live performance tradition of improvis- 
ing verses—a type of ex tempore composition and 
singing called bertsolaritza.  Verses in bertsolar- 
itza can be seen as discourses   with strict rules 
governing the technical structure of them: verses 
must contain a certain number of lines and each 
line must have a defined number of syllables, cer- 
tain lines have to rhyme in certain patterns, and so 
forth.
  In this paper we present a web-based assistant 
tool for constructing  verses (bertsoak) according 
to the rules of bertsolaritza (Garzia et al, 2001).
  If the reader is interested in this topic, we rec-

2   Relationship to earlier work

There exist some prior works dealing with Basque 
verse-making and computer technologies, such as 
BertsolariXa (Arrieta et al., 2001), which is a 
rhyme search tool implemented  as finite-state au- 
tomata using the two-level morphology formal- 
ism. The tool also contains other features, includ- 
ing semantic categorization of words, narrowing 
word-searches to certain themes, etc. While Bert- 
solariXa focuses mostly on the word-level, the 
current work also includes constraints on over- 
all verse structure in its implementation  as well 
as a synonym   search tool, a melody  suggestion 
system, and possibilities  for plugging in text-to- 
speech synthesis of verses.

2.1   The Bertsolari tradition

Bertsolaritza is very ingrained in  the Basque 
Country and championships,  competitions  and 
get-togethers on bertsolaritza are quite common. 
Usually the competitors in such event, called bert- 
solaris,  are given a theme to produce  a verse on 
under some very limited  time constraints.
  But the Basque Country is not the only place 
that hosts such troubadour traditions—similar 
customs are present in many other countries such 
as Cuba,  Brazil, Argentina, etc. The goal of the 
current tool is to be generalizable,  and so appli- 
cable to various strategies of verse improvisation, 
and possibly be useful not only for Basque speak- 
ers, but also for others.
  Below we briefly  present an example of a verse 
made in the Basque Country. In 1986 Andoni 
Egan˜ a  (a well-known bertsolari) was  asked  to 
sing a bertso and assigned a topic. In the verse, 
he was asked to play the role of an old person 
who lived alone, and who realized that he could

not even tie his shoes.  Within a few seconds he 
composed and sang three verses.  Here, we ana- 
lyze the first verse.

Verse:
Gazte aroan ibili arren 
gustora tirriki-tarra,
denbora honen joan etorriak 
ederki jo dit gitarra,
gorputza daukat ximeldurikan 
ta eskuen punta zaharra, 
denborarekin seko galdu det 
gazte aroko indarra,
ez al da pena gizon mardul bat 
hola ibili beharra.

Translation:
Even when I was young 
I was always on a spree 
over time
I have been punished
I have a crumpled body
and the tip of the hands very old, 
Over time I lost
the strength I had when I was young, 
It’s a shame that a strong man
has to end up like me.

  The special  charm of bertsolaritza improvi- 
sation is that people proficient in the art can 
quickly express a variety  of ideas, although they 
are working with very restrictive  rules concern- 
ing the number of syllables in words they use, 
and how the words must rhyme. We must take 
into account that Andoni Egan˜ a was able to sing 
this verse within a few seconds of being given 
the topic, and also, that it complies exactly with 
a certain  metric. In this case, the verse contains 
eight lines, each odd line consisting of ten sylla- 
bles, and each even line of eight syllables, with 
the even lines rhyming.
  Formal training in the bertsolari  tradition also 
exists in the Basque Country. In the last 20 to
30 years, an important  movement  has developed 
that aims to provide instruction to upcoming gen- 
erations  on how to create  verses  (orally or in 
writing).  This kind of instruction usually takes 
place in learning  centers called bertso-eskolak, 
which in English roughly  means, “verse-making 
schools.” The proliferation of this movement has 
produced  a strong  base of young bertsolaris, of 
whom many achieve an outstanding level of im- 
provisation skills.


3   The BAD tool

BAD is the acronym for “Bertsotarako Arbel Dig- 
itala”, roughly “Digital verse board.”   The aim 
of the tool is to serve  as a general  assistant  for 
bertsolari-style verse composition and help verse- 
making learners in their learning process.
  This tool has been developed  using  the PHP 
programming  language, but it  contains certain 
parts developed using finite-state technology. The 
main functions of this tool, which will  be dis- 
cussed in more detail in the next five sections, are 
the following: visualization of the verse structure, 
structure checking, rhyme and synonym searching 
and verse singing.

3.1   Verse structure

The main rules of the bertsolari  verse are that a 
verse must consist of a certain predefined number 
of lines and each line in turn, of a predefined num- 
ber of syllables. Traditionally,  about a hundred 
different  schemes are used, and the tool provides 
support for all these patterns. For example, the 
structure called “Hamarreko handia” has ten lines 
and ten syllables in the odd-numbered lines, and 
eight syllables in the even-numbered lines. In this 
structure, the even-numbered lines have to rhyme. 
Selecting this scheme, the tool will mark the cor- 
responding lines with their requirements.
  The web interface  can be seen  in figure 1, 
which shows the general layout of the tool, illus- 
trated with the example verse referred to above— 
we see that each line has been approved in terms 
of line length and syllable structure by the tool.
  We have designed a database in which the main 
verse structures are saved so that when the user se- 
lects one verse schema, the system knows exactly 
the number of lines it must contain, where must 
it rhyme and how many syllables each line should 
have. Those schemata are also linked to melodies, 
each melody corresponding to one possible struc- 
ture.

3.2   Structure checking

After writing the verse, the system can evaluate if 
it is technically correct, i.e. if the overall structure 
is correct and if each line in the form abides by the 
required syllable count and rhyming scheme. The 
syllable counter is implemented using the foma 
software (Hulden, 2009), and the implementation 
(Hulden, 2006) can be found on the homepage of

foma.3
  Separately,  we have also developed  a rhyme 
checker,  which extracts  special  patterns in the 
lines that must rhyme and checks their confor- 
mity.
  These patterns are extracted  using  foma (see 
section 3.4) after which some phonological rules 
are applied. For example, an example rule era
→ {era, eda, ega, eba}, models the fact that any 
word ending in era, for example,  etxera, will 
rhyme with all words that end in era, eda, eba or 
ega. These rhyming  patterns have been extracted 
according to the phonological laws described in 
(Amuriza, 1981).

3.3   Synonym search

Usually, people who write verses tend to quickly 
exhaust  their vocabulary and ideas with to ex- 
press what they want to say, or encounter prob- 
lems with the number of syllables in various ten- 
tative words they have in mind.  For example, 
if the verse-maker wants to say something  con- 
taining the word “family,” (familia in Euskera,  a 
four-syllable word) but is forced to use a three- 
syllable word in a particular  context,  the inter- 
face provides for possibilities to look for three- 
syllable synonyms of the word familia, producing 
the word sendia— a word whose meaning is oth- 
erwise the same, and made up of three syllables.
  For developing  the synonym search, we used a 
modified version of the Basque Wordnet (Pociello

3 http://foma.googlecode.com


et al., 2010), originally developed by the IXA 
group at the University of the Basque Country. 
Within Wordnet we search the synsets for the in- 
coming word, and the words that correspond to 
those synsets are returned.

3.4   Rhyme search

The classical and most well-known problem in 
bertsolaritza  concern the rhyming patterns. As 
mentioned, various lines within a verse  are re- 
quired to rhyme, according to certain predefined 
schemata.  To search for words that rhyme with 
other words in a verse, the BAD tool contains  a 
rhyme search engine.  In the interface, this is lo- 
cated in the right part of the BAD tool main view, 
as seen in figure 2.
  The rhyme searcher is built upon finite-state 
technology, commonly  used for developing mor- 
phological  and phonological  analyzers, and calls 
upon the freely available foma-tool, to calculate 
matching and nonmatching rhyme schemes.
  Its grammar is made up of regular expressions 
that are used to identify phonological patterns in 
final syllables in the input word.  The result of 
the search is the intersection of these patterns and 
all the words generated from a morphological  de- 
scription of Basque (Alegria et al., 1996)—that 
is, a list of all words that match both the required 
phonological  constraints given (rhyming) and a 
morphological description of Basque.
  Based upon figure 2, if we search rhymes for 
the word landa  (cottage),  the system proposes a

set of words that can be filtered depending on the 
number of syllables required. Among this list of 
words, we can find some words that end in anda, 
such as, Irlanda (Ireland) or eztanda (explosion), 
but through the application of phonological equiv- 
alency rules we also find terms like ganga (vault).

3.5   Singing synthesis
Another  characteristic,  as mentioned,  is that, in 
the end, the verses are intended  to be sung in- 
stead of only being textually  represented. Based 
on other ongoing work in singing synthesis, we 
have designed a system for singing the verses en- 
tered into the system in Basque.
  This is based on the “singing mode” of the Fes- 
tival text-to-speech system (Taylor et al., 1998). 
The advantage  of using this is that Festival is 
open-source and has given us ample opportunities 
to modify its behavior.  However, as Festival does 
not currently support Basque directly, we have re- 
lied on the Spanish support of the Festival sys- 
tem.4
  4 While morphologically  and syntactically,  Spanish and 
Basque  have no relationship whatsoever, phonetically  the 
languages are quite close, with only a few phonemes, syl-



  Based on current work by the Aholab research 
team in Bilbao—a lab that works on Basque 
speech synthesis and recognition—we  have im- 
plemented a singing  module for BAD, based on 
the text-to-speech HTS engine (Erro et al., 2010). 
Our application  is able to sing the composed 
verses entered into the system in Basque, with a 
choice of various standard melodies for bertsolar- 
itza.5

4   Discussion and future  work

Now that the BAD tool has been developed,  our 
intention is to evaluate it.   To make a qualita- 
tive evaluation we have gotten in touch with some 
verse-making  schools (bertso-eskola),  so that they 
can test the system and send us their feedback us- 
ing a form. Once the evaluation is made, we will 
improve it according to the feedback and the sys- 
tem will be made public.
  Our ultimate goal is to develop a system able to 
create verses automatically.  To achieve this long- 
term goal, there is plenty of work to do and ba- 
sic research to be done.  We have in our hands a 
good corpus of 3,500 Basque verse transcriptions, 
so we intend to study  these verses from a mor- 
phological, syntactical, semantical and pragmatic 
point of view.
  In the short term, we also plan to expand the 
synonym  search to be able to provide  searches 
for semantically  related words and subjects (and 
not just synonyms), like hypernyms or hyponyms. 
The Basque WordNet provides a good opportu- 
nity for this, as one is easily able to traverse the 
WordNet to encounter words with varying degrees 
of semantic similarity.
  Another feature that we want to develop is a 
system that receives as input  a verse together with 
a MIDI file, and where the system automatically 
sings the verse to the music provided.
  Finally,   in  order  for  the  system to  be 
able to provide better proposals  for the verse 
artist—including perhaps humorous and creative 
proposals—we intend to work with approaches 
to computational creativity. We are considering 
different  approaches to this topic, such as in the 
work on Hahacronym (Stock et al., 2005) or the 
Standup riddle builder (Ritchie et al., 2001).

labification  rules, and stress rules being different  enough to 
disturb the system’s behavior.

interface  as of yet.
