<S sid ="0">Estimation of Conditional ProbabilitiesWith Decision Trees and an Application to Fine-Grained POS Tagging</S>
<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">We present a HMM part-of-speech tagging method which is particularly suited for POS tagsets with a large number of fine-grained tags.</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">It is based on three ideas: (1) splitting of the POS tags into attribute vectors and decomposition of the contextual POS probabilities of the HMM into a product of attribute probabilities, (2) estimation of the contextual probabilities with decision trees, and (3) use of high-order HMMs.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">In experiments on German and Czech data, our tagger outperformed state- of-the-art POS taggers.</S>
