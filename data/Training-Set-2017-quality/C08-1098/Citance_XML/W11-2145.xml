			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">In this paper we describe our systems for the EMNLP 2011 Sixth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation.</S>
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">We participated in the Shared Translation Task and submitted translations for English↔German and English↔French.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">We use a phrase-based decoder that can use lattices as input and developed several models that extend the standard log-linear model combination of phrase-based MT. These include advanced reordering models and corresponding adaptations to the phrase extraction process as well as extension to the translation and language model in form of discriminative word alignment and a bilingual language model to extend source word context.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">For EnglishGerman, language models based on fine-grained part-of-speech tags were used to address the difficult target language generation due to the rich morphology of German.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">We also present a filtering method directly addressing the problems of web-crawled corpora, which enabled us to make use of the French-English Giga corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Another novelty in our systems this year is the parallel phrase scoring method that reduces the time needed for training which is especially convenient for such big corpora as the Giga corpus.</S>

			<S sid ="10" ssid = "1">The baseline systems for all languages use a translation model that is trained on EPPS and the News Commentary corpus and the phrase table is based on a GIZA++ word alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "2">The language model was trained on the monolingual parts of the same corpora by the SRILM Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "3">It is a 4-gram SRI language model using KneserNey smoothing.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "4">The problem of word reordering is addressed using the POS-based reordering model as described in Section 2.4.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "5">The part-of-speech tags for the reordering model are obtained using the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "6">An in-house phrase-based decoder (Vogel, 2003) is used to perform translation and optimization with regard to the BLEU score is done using Minimum Error Rate Training as described in Venugopal et al.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "7">(2005).</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "8">During decoding only the top 20 translation options for every source phrase were considered.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "9">2.1 Data.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "10">We trained all systems using the parallel EPPS and News Commentary corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "11">In addition, the UN corpus and the Giga corpus were used for training 379 Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 379–385, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, July 30–31, 2011.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "12">Qc 2011 Association for Computational Linguistics the French-English systems.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "13">Optimization was done for most languages using the news-test2008 data set and news-test2010 was used as test set.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "14">The only exception is GermanEnglish, where news-test2009 was used for optimization due to system combination arrangements.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "15">The language models for the baseline systems were trained on the monolingual versions of the training corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "16">Later on, we used the News Shuffle and the Gigaword corpus to train bigger language models.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "17">For training a discriminative word alignment model, a small amount of hand-aligned data was used.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "18">2.2 Preprocessing.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "19">The training data is preprocessed prior to training the system.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "20">This includes normalizing special symbols, smart-casing the first words of each sentence and removing long sentences and sentences with length mismatch.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "21">For the German parts of the training corpus we use the hunspell1 lexicon to map words written according to old German spelling to new German spelling, to obtain a corpus with homogenous spelling.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "22">Compound splitting as described in Koehn and Knight (2003) is applied to the German part of the corpus for the German-to-English system to reduce the out-of-vocabulary problem for German compound words.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "23">2.3 Special filtering of the Giga parallel Corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "24">The Giga corpus incorporates non-neglegible amounts of noise even after our usual preprocessing.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "25">This noise may be due to different causes.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "26">For instance: nonstandard HTML characters, meaningless parts composed of only hypertext codes, sentences which are only partial translation of the source, or eventually not a correct translation at all.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "27">Such noisy pairs potentially degrade the translation model quality, therefore it seemed more convenient to eliminate them.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "28">Given the size of the corpus, this task could not be performed manually.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "29">Consequently, we used an automatic classifier inspired by the work of Munteanu sifier should be able to filter out the pairs which likely are not beneficial for the translation model.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "30">In order to reliably decide about the classifier to use, we evaluated several techniques.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "31">The training and test sets for this evaluation were built respectively from ncdev2007 and ncdevtest2007.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "32">In each set, about 30% randomly selected source sentences switch positions with the immediate following so that they form negative examples.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "33">We also used lexical dictionaries in both directions based on EPPS and UN corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "34">We relied on seven features in our classifiers: IBM1 score in both directions, number of unaligned source words, the difference in number of words between source and target, the maximum source word fertility, number of unaligned target words, and the maximum target word fertility.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "35">It is noteworthy that all the features requiring alignment information (such as the unaligned source words) were computed on the basis of the Viterbi path of the IBM1 alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "36">The following classifiers were used: Regression Choose either class based on a weighted linear combination of the features and a fixed threshold of 0.5.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "37">Logistic regression The probability of the class is expressed as a sigmoid of a linear combination of the different features.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "38">Then the class with the highest probability is picked.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "39">Maximum entropy classifier We used the same set of features to train a maximum entropy classifier using the Megam package2.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "40">Support vector machines classifier An SVM classifier was trained using the SVM-light pack- age3.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "41">Results of these experiments are summarized in Table 1.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "42">The regression weights were estimated so that to minimize the squared error.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "43">This gave us a pretty poor F-measure score of 90.42%.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "44">Given that the logistic regression is more suited for binary classification in our case than the normal regression, it led to significant increase in the performance.</S>

			<S sid ="60" ssid = "51">This gave an F-measure score of 94.78%.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "52">The maximum entropy classifier performed better than the logistic regression in terms of precision but however it had worse F-measure.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "53">Significant improvements could be noticed using the SVM classifier in both precision and recall: 98.20% precision, 96.87% recall, and thus 97.53% F-measure.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "54">As a result, we used the SVM classifier to filter the Giga parallel corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "55">The corpus contained originally around 22.52 million pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "56">After preprocessing and filtering it was reduced to 16.7 million pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "57">Thus throwing around 6 million pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "58">2.4 Word Reordering.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "59">In contrast to modeling the reordering by a distance- based reordering model and/or a lexicalized distortion model, we use a different approach that relies on part-of-speech (POS) sequences.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "60">By abstracting from surface words to parts-of-speech, we expect to model the reordering more accurately.</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "61">2.4.1 POS-based Reordering Model To model reordering we first learn probabilistic rules from the POS tags of the words in the training corpus and the alignment information.</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "62">Continuous reordering rules are extracted as described in Rottmann and Vogel (2007) to model short-range reorderings.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "63">When translating between German and English, we apply a modified reordering model with non-continuous rules to cover also long-range reorderings (Niehues and Kolss, 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "64">The reordering rules are applied to the source text and the original order of words and the reordered sentence variants generated by the rules are encoded in a word lattice which is used as input to the decoder.would be able to extract the phrase pairs for orig inally discontinuous phrases and could apply them during translation of reordered test sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "65">Therefore, we build reordering lattices for all training sentences and then extract phrase pairs from the monotone source path as well as from the reordered paths.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "66">To limit the number of extracted phrase pairs, we extract a source phrase only once per sentence even if it is found in different paths.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "67">2.5 Translation and Language Models.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "68">In addition to the models used in the baseline system described above we conducted experiments including additional models that enhance translation quality by introducing alternative or additional information into the translation or language modelling process.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "69">2.5.1 Discriminative Word Alignment In most of our systems we use the PGIZA++ Toolkit4 to generate alignments between words in the training corpora.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "70">The word alignments are generated in both directions and the grow-diag-final-and heuristic is used to combine them.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "71">The phrase extraction is then done based on this word alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "72">In the EnglishGerman system we applied the Discriminative Word Alignment approach as described in Niehues and Vogel (2008) instead.</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "73">This alignment model is trained on a small corpus of hand-aligned data and uses the lexical probability as well as the fertilities generated by the PGIZA++ Toolkit and POS information.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "74">2.5.2 Bilingual Language Model In phrase-based systems the source sentence is segmented by the decoder according to the best combination of phrases that maximize the translation and language model scores.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "75">This segmentation into phrases leads to the loss of context information at the phrase boundaries.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "76">Although more target side context is available to the language model, source 4 http://www.cs.cmu.edu/˜qing/ side context would also be valuable for the decoder when searching for the best translation hypothesis.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "77">To make also source language context available we use a bilingual language model, an additional language model in the phrase-based system in which each token consist of a target word and all source words it is aligned to.</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "78">The bilingual tokens enter the translation process as an additional target factor and the bilingual language model is applied to the additional factor like a normal language model.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "79">For more details see (Niehues et al., 2011).</S>
			<S sid ="89" ssid = "80">2.5.3 Parallel phrase scoring The process of phrase scoring is held in two runs.</S>
			<S sid ="90" ssid = "81">The objective of the first run is to compute the necessary counts and to estimate the scores, all based on the source phrases; while the second run is similarly held based on the target phrases.</S>
			<S sid ="91" ssid = "82">Thus, the extracted phrases have to be sorted twice: once by source phrase and once by target phrase.</S>
			<S sid ="92" ssid = "83">These two sorting operations are almost always done on an external storage device and hence consume most of the time spent in this step.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "84">The phrase scoring step was reimplemented in order to exploit the available computation resources more efficiently and therefore reduce the processing time.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "85">It uses optimized sorting algorithms for large data volumes which cannot fit into memory (Vitter, 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "86">In its core, our implementation relies on STXXL: an extension of the STL library for external memory (Kettner, 2005) and on OpenMP for shared memory parallelization (Chapman et al., 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "87">Table 2 shows a comparison between Moses and our phrase scoring tools.</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "88">The comparison was held using sixteen-core 64-bit machines with 128 Gb RAM, where the files are accessed through NFS on a RAID disk.</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "89">The experiments show that the gain grows linearly with the size of input with an average of 40% of speed up.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "90">2.5.4 POS Language Models In addition to surface word language models, we did experiments with language models based on part-of-speech for EnglishGerman.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "91">We expect that having additional information in form of probabilities of part-of-speech sequences should help especially in case of the rich morphology of German and #pairs(G) Moses ∗103(s) KIT ∗103(s) 0.203 25.99 17.58 1.444 184.19 103.41 1.693 230.97 132.79 Table 2: Comparison of Moses and KIT phrase extraction systems therefore the more difficult target language generation.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "92">The part-of-speeches were generated using the TreeTagger and the RFTagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008), which produces more fine-grained tags that include also person, gender and case information.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "93">While the TreeTagger assigns 54 different POS tags to the 357K German words in the corpus, the RFTagger produces 756 different fine-grained tags on the same corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "94">We tried n-gram lengths of 4 and 7.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "95">While no improvement in translation quality could be achieved using the POS language models based on the normal POS tags, the 4-gram POS language model based on fine-grained tags could improve the translation system by 0.2 BLEU points as shown in Table 3.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "96">Surprisingly, increasing the n-gram length to 7 decreased the translation quality again.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "97">To investigate the impact of context length, we performed an analysis on the outputs of two different systems, one without a POS language model and one with the 4-gram fine-grained POS language model.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "98">For each of the translations we calculated the average length of the n-grams in the translation when applying one of the two language models using 4- grams of surface words or parts-of-speech.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "99">The results are also shown in Table 3.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "100">The average n-gram length of surface words on the translation generated by the system without POS language model and the one using the 4-gram POS language model stays practically the same.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "101">When measuring the n-gram length using the 4-gram POS language model, the context increases to 3.4.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "102">This increase of context is not surprising, since with the more general POS tags longer contexts can be matched.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "103">Comparing the POS context length for the two translations, we can see that the context increases from 3.18 to 3.40 due to longer matching POS sequences.</S>

			<S sid ="123" ssid = "5">The German-to-English baseline system applies short-range reordering rules and uses a language model trained on the EPPS and News Commentary.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "6">By exchanging the baseline language model by one trained on the News Shuffle corpus we improve the translation quality considerably, by more than 3 BLEU points.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "7">When we expand the coverage of the reordering rules to enable long-range reordering we can improve even further by 0.4 and adding a second language model trained on the English Gigaword corpus we gain another 0.3 BLEU points.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "8">To ensure that the phrase table also includes reordered phrases, we use lattice phrase extraction and can achieve a small improvement.</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "9">Finally, a bilingual language model is added to extend the context of source language words available for translation, reaching the best score of 23.35 BLEU points.</S>

			<S sid ="159" ssid = "2">For English↔French, a spe cial filtering method for web-crawled data was developed.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "3">In addition, a parallel phrase scoring technique was implemented that could speed up the MT training process tremendously.</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "4">Using these two features, we were able to integrate the huge amounts of data available in the Giga corpus into our systems translating between English and French.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "5">We applied POS-based reordering to improve our translations in all directions, using short-range reordering for English↔French and long-range reordering for English↔German.</S>
			<S sid ="163" ssid = "6">For German English, reordering also the training corpus lead to further improvements of the translation quality.</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "7">A Discriminative Word Alignment Model led to an increase in BLEU for EnglishGerman.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "8">For this direction we also tried fine-grained POS language models of different n-gram lengths.</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "9">The best translations could be obtained by using 4-grams.</S>
			<S sid ="167" ssid = "10">For nearly all experiments, a bilingual language model was applied that expands the context of source words that can be considered during decoding.</S>
			<S sid ="168" ssid = "11">The improvements range from 0.1 to 0.4 in BLEU score.</S>
