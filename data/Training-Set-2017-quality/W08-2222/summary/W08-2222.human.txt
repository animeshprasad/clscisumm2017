In this paper, the authors describe Boxer, their open-domain software component for semantic analysis of text, based on Combinatory Categorical Grammar (CCG) and Discourse Representation Theory (DRT). Boxer is an open-domain software component for semantic analysis of text, based on Combinatory Categorical Grammar (CCG) and Discourse Representation Theory (DRT). Based on Discourse Representation Theory Boxer is able to construct Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs for short, informally called “boxes” because of the way they are graphically displayed) for English sentences and texts. Boxer implements a syntax-semantics interface based on Combinatory Categorical Grammar, CCG. Because the syntax-semantics is clearly defined, the choice of logical form can be independent of the categorical framework underlying it. Boxer’s performance on the shared task for comparing semantic representations was promising. It was able to produce DRSs for all texts. The authors can’t quantify the quality of Boxer’s output, as they don’t have gold standard representations at our disposal.
