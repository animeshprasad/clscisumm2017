Abstract


We present a named entity recognition and 
classification system that uses only probabilis- 
tic character-level features.  Classifications by 
multiple orthographic tries are combined in a 
hidden Markov model framework to incorpo- 
rate both internal and contextual evidence. As 
part of the system, we perform a preprocess- 
ing stage in which capitalisation is restored to 
sentence-initial and all-caps words with high 
accuracy.    We report f-values of 86.65 and
79.78 for English, and 50.62 and 54.43 for the
German datasets.


1   Introduction

Language independent NER requires the development of 
a metalinguistic model that is sufficiently broad to ac- 
commodate all languages, yet can be trained to exploit 
the specific features of the target language.  Our aim in 
this paper is to investigate the combination of a character- 
level model, orthographic tries, with a sentence-level hid- 
den Markov model. The local model uses affix informa- 
tion from a word and its surrounds to classify each word 
independently, and relies on the sentence-level model to 
determine a correct state sequence.
  Capitalisation is an often-used discriminator for NER, 
but can be misleading in sentence-initial or all-caps text. 
We choose to use a model that makes no assumptions 
about the capitalisation scheme, or indeed the character 
set, of the target language. We solve the problem of mis- 
leading case in a novel way by removing the effects of 
sentence-initial or all-caps capitalisation. This results in a 
simpler language model and easier recognition of named 
entities while remaining strongly language independent.


2   Probabilistic Classification using
Orthographic Tries

Tries are an efficient data structure for capturing statis- 
tical differences between strings in different categories. 
In an orthographic trie, a path from the root through n 
nodes represents a string a1 a2 . . . an .   The n-th node 
in the path stores the occurrences (frequency) of the 
string a1 a2 . . . an  in each word category.   These fre- 
quencies can be used to calculate probability estimates
P (c | a1 a2 . . . an ) for each category c. Tries have previ-
ously been used in both supervised (Patrick et al., 2002)
and unsupervised (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999) named 
entity recognition.
  Each node in an orthographic trie stores the cumula- 
tive frequency information for each category in which a 
given string of characters occurs. A heterogeneous node 
represents a string that occurs in more than one category, 
while a homogeneous node represents a string that occurs 
in only one category.  If a string a1 a2 . . . an  occurs in 
only one category, all longer strings a1 a2 . . . an . . . an+k 
are also of the same category.  This redundancy can be 
exploited when constructing a trie. We build minimum- 
depth MD-tries which have the condition that all nodes 
are heterogeneous, and all leaves are homogeneous. MD- 
tries are only as large as is necessary to capture the dif- 
ferences between categories, and can be built efficiently 
to large depths. MD-tries have been shown to give better 
performance than a standard trie with the same number 
of nodes (Whitelaw and Patrick, 2002).
  Given a string a1 a2 . . . an and a category c an ortho- 
graphic trie yields a set of relative probabilities P (c | a1 ), 
P (c | a1 a2 ), . . ., P (c | a1 a2 . . . an ). The probability that
a string indicates a particular class is estimated along the 
whole trie path, which helps to smooth scores for rare 
strings. The contribution of each level in the trie is gov- 
erned by a linear weighting function of the form




n
P (c | a1 a2 . . . an ) = ) λi P (c | a1 a2 . . . ai )
i=1


n
where λi  ∈ [0, 1]	and ) λi  = 1
i=1
  Tries are highly language independent. They make no 
assumptions about character set, or the relative impor- 
tance of different parts of a word or its context. Tries use 
a progressive back-off and smoothing model that is well 
suited to the classification of previously unseen words. 
While each trie looks only at a single context, multiple 
tries can be used together to capture both word-internal 
and external contextual evidence of class membership.

3   Restoring Case Information

In European languages, named entities are often distin- 
guished through their use of capitalisation.  However, 
capitalisation commonly plays another role, that of mark- 
ing the first word in a sentence.  In addition, some sen- 
tences such as newspaper headlines are written in all- 
capitals for emphasis.  In these environments, the case 
information that has traditionally been so useful to NER 
systems is lost.
  Previous work in NER has been aware of this prob- 
lem of dealing with words without accurate case informa- 
tion, and various workarounds have been exploited. Most 
commonly, feature-based classifiers use a set of capitali- 
sation features and a sentence-initial feature (Bikel et al.,
1997). Chieu and Ng used global information such as the 
occurrence of the same word with other capitalisation in 
the same document (Chieu and Ng, 2002a), and have also 
used a mixed-case classifier to teach a “weaker” classifier 
that did not use case information at all (Chieu and Ng,
2002b).
  We propose a different solution to the problem of case- 
less words.  Rather than noting their lack of case and 
treating them separately, we propose to restore the cor- 
rect capitalisation as a preprocessing step, allowing all 
words to be treated in the same manner.  If this process 
of case restoration is sufficiently accurate, capitalisation 
should be more correctly associated with entities, result- 
ing in better recognition performance.
  Restoring case information is not equivalent to distin- 
guishing common nouns from proper nouns. This is par- 
ticularly evident in German, where all types of nouns are 
written with an initial capital letter. The purpose of case 
restoration is simply to reveal the underlying capitalisa- 
tion model of the language, allowing machine learners to 
learn more accurately from orthography.
  We propose two methods, each of which requires a cor- 
pus with accurate case information. Such a corpus is eas- 
ily obtained; any unannotated corpus can be used once




Table 1: Case restoration performance using an MD-trie, 
English.



sentence-initial words and allcaps sentences have been 
excluded.  For both languages, the training corpus con- 
sisted of the raw data, training and test data combined.
  The first method for case restoration is to replace a 
caseless word with its most frequent form.  Word capi- 
talisation frequencies can easily be computed for corpora 
of any size. The major weakness of this technique is that 
each word is classified individually without regard for 
its context.  For instance, “new” will always be written 
in lowercase, even when it is part of a valid capitalised 
phrase such as “New York”.
  The second method uses an MD-trie which, if allowed 
to extend over word boundaries, can effectively capture 
the cases where a word has multiple possible forms. 
Since an MD-trie is only built as deep as is required to 
capture differences between categories, most paths will 
still be quite shallow.  As in other word categorisation 
tasks, tries can robustly deal with unseen words by per- 
forming classification on the longest matchable prefix.
  To test these recapitalisation methods, the raw, train- 
ing, and development sets were used as the training set. 
From the second test set, only words with known case 
information were used for testing, resulting in corpora 
of 30484 and 39639 words for English and German re- 
spectively. Each word was classified as either lowercase 
(“new”), initial-caps (“New”), all-caps(“U.S.”), or inner- 
caps (“ex-English”). On this test set, the word-frequency 
method and the trie-based method achieved accuracies of
93.9% and 95.7% respectively for English, and 95.4% 
and 96.3% in German.  Table 1 shows the trie perfor- 
mance for English in more detail. In practice, it is usu- 
ally possible to train on the same corpus as is being re- 
capitalised.   This will give more accurate information 
for those words which appear in both known-case and 
unknown-case positions, and should yield higher accu- 
racy.
  This process of restoring case information is language 
independent and requires only an unannotated corpus in 
the target language.  It is a pre-processing step that can 
be ignored for languages where case information is either 
not present or is not lost.

4   Classification Process

The training data was converted to use the IOB2 phrase 
model (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999). This phrase 
model was found to be more appropriate to the nature of 
NE phrases in both languages, in that the first word in 
the phrase may behave differently to consecutive words. 
MD-Tries were trained on the prefix and suffix of the cur- 
rent word, and the left and right surrounding contexts. 
Each trie Tx  produces an independent probability esti-
mate, PTx (c |  context).   These probabilities are com-
bined to produce a single estimate

n
P (c | context) = n PT (c | context)
i=0

  These probabilities are then used directly as obser- 
vation probabilities in a hidden Markov model (HMM) 
framework.  An HMM uses probability matrices Π, A, 
and B for the initial state, state transitions, and symbol 
emissions respectively (Manning and Schu¨ tze, 1999). We 
derive Π and A from the training set. Rather than explic- 
itly defining B, trie-based probability estimates are used 
directly within the standard Viterbi algorithm, which ex- 
ploits dynamic programming to efficiently search the en- 
tire space of state assignments. Illegal assignments, such 
as an I-PER without a preceding B-PER, cannot arise due 
to the restrictions of the transition matrix.
  The datasets for both languages contained extra infor- 
mation including chunk and part-of-speech information, 
as well as lemmas for the German data. While these are 
rich sources of data, and may help especially in the recog- 
nition phase, our aim was to investigate the feasibility of 
a purely orthographic approach, and as such no extra in- 
formation was used.

5   Results

Table 2 shows how the system performs in terms of 
recognition. There is a large discrepancy between recog- 
nition performance for English and German.  For Ger- 
man, it appears that there is insufficient morphological 
information in a word and its immediate context to reli- 
ably discriminate between NEs and common nouns. Pre- 
cision is markedly higher than recall across all tests. The 
most common error in English was the misclassification

of a single-term entity as a non-entity, while multi-word
entities were more successfully identified.
  Table 3 shows the overall performance difference be- 
tween words present in the tagged training corpus and 
those that only occurred in the test set.  For previously 
seen words, both recognition and classification perform 
well, aided by the variable depth of MD-tries. The pro- 
gressive back-off model of tries is quite effective in clas- 
sifying new tokens, achieving up to 85% accuracy in clas- 
sification unseen entities.  It is interesting to note that, 
given a successful recognition phase, German NEs are 
more successfully classified than English NEs.
  The effects of heuristically restoring case information 
can be seen in Table 4.  The contribution of recapitali- 
sation is limited by the proportion of entities in caseless 
positions. Both the word-based method and the trie-based 
method produced improvements. The higher accuracy of 
the trie-based approach gives better overall performance. 
The final results for each language and dataset are 
given in Table 5.  Both English datasets have the same 
performance profile: results for the PER and LOC cat- 
egories were markedly better than the MISC and ORG 
categories. Since seen and unseen performance remained 
quite stable, the lower results for the second test set can 
be explained by a higher percentage of previously unseen 
words. While MISC is traditionally the worst-performing 
category, the lowest results were for ORG. This pattern of 
performance was different to that for German, in which 
MISC was consistently identified less well than the other
categories.

6   Conclusion

We have presented a very simple system that uses only 
internal and contextual character-level evidence.  This 
highly language-independent model performs well on 
both seen and unseen tokens despite using only the su-



pervised training data.  The incorporation of trie-based 
estimates into an HMM framework allows the optimal tag 
sequence to be found for each sentence.
  We have also shown that case information can be re- 
stored with high accuracy using simple machine learn- 
ing techniques, and that this restoration is beneficial to 
named entity recognition.  We would expect most NER 
systems to benefit from this recapitalisation process, es- 
pecially in fields without accurate case information, such 
as transcribed text or allcaps newswire.
  Trie-based classification yields probability estimates 
that are highly suitable for use as features in a further 
machine learning process. This approach has the advan- 
tage of being highly language-independent, and requiring 
fewer features than traditional orthographic feature repre- 
sentations.
