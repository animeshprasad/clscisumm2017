<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">Part-of-speech (POS) tag distributions are known to exhibit sparsity â€” a word is likely to take a single predominant tag in a corpus.</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating this sparsity constraint improves tagging accuracy.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">However, in existing systems, this expansion come with a steep increase in model complexity.</S>
<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">This paper proposes a simple and effective tagging method that directly models tag sparsity and other distributional properties of valid POS tag assignments.</S>
<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">In addition, this formulation results in a dramatic reduction in the number of model parameters thereby, enabling unusually rapid training.</S>
<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">Our experiments consistently demonstrate that this model architecture yields substantial performance gains over more complex tagging counterparts.</S>
<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">On several languages, we report performance exceeding that of more complex state-of-the art systems.1</S>
