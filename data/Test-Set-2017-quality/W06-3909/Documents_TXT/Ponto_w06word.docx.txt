Abstract. 

We  investigate  the  extraction  of ontologies  from biological 
text using a semantic representation derived from a robust parser. The 
use of a semantic representation avoids the problems that traditional 
pattern-based approaches have with complex syntactic constructions and 
long-distance dependencies. The discovery of taxonomic relationships is 
explored  in a corpus consisting  of 12,200 animal-related  articles  from 
the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia. The semantic representation used is 
Robust Minimal Recursion Semantics (RMRS). Initial experiments show 
good results in systematising extraction across a variety of hyponymic 
constructions.

1    Introduction

Ontology  extraction  has traditionally  relied on pattern  matching  algorithms. 
Hearst [5] introduced hyponymic extraction using lexico-syntactic patterns. In 
the  Hearst  algorithm,  the  system  looks  for instances  of certain  expressions  in 
the text, for example ‘X is a Y’ or ‘X such as Y and Z’, and infers the relations
‘X is-a Y’ and ‘X is-a Z’. Such systems are usually based on regular expressions 
over text or POS-tagged text, and sentences containing apposition, bracketing, 
long-distance dependencies or uncommon structures have to be coded explicitly. 
An example of such a sentence, extracted from the Wikipedia encyclopaedia, is:

The Firemouth Cichlid is one of the ‘typical’ and most commonly seen
(in pet stores) of the Cichlasoma-type South American cichlids.

Here obtaining the relationship ‘Firemouth cichlid is-a cichlid’ involves the iden- 
tification of the hyponym and hypernym as the first and last noun phrases of a 
lengthy sentence. This suggests that traditional methods might be improved by 
using deeper syntactic and semantic analysis.
   The work presented here investigates the use of a semantic model to address 
some of these issues. Robust Minimal Recursion Semantics (RMRS, [4]) provides 
argument-based representation of sentences. The theoretical idea is that, in the 
problematic sentence above, an RMRS output would contain the predicate as- 
sociated with the identity copula be with a first argument corresponding to the



term Firemouth cichlid and a second argument corresponding to cichlids, regard- 
less of the word order, modification and so on. Thus, having obtained the RMRS 
representation of a given corpus, it would be possible to extract ontological rela- 
tionships from a semantic structure that abstracts over those morphological and 
syntactic details that do not affect the ontological relationship.
   As  pointed  out by Pennacchiotti  and Pantel  [6], most  ontology  extraction 
systems  so  far have  focused on generalised  is-a  or part-of  relationships.  Our 
work involves extracting general hyponymic relations with RMRS and applying 
a filter to the results to obtain biological, taxonomic relationships. The corpus 
was gathered by extracting 12,200 animal articles from the Wikipedia online 
encyclopaedia (http://www.wikipedia.org/), providing a semi-edited setting 
where the added robustness of semantics might prove its usefulness.
   The next section of this paper gives an overview of relevant prior work. It is 
followed by the description of an extraction system based on RMRS, using hard- 
wired rules. Results are discussed in the light of four different evaluation meth- 
ods covering both manual and automatic recall and precision. A brief overview 
is then given of a further system, still under development, the aim of which is 
to  automate  the  pattern  extraction  process. The conclusion presents  different 
avenues for future work.


2    Previous Work

The most widely used framework for automatic ontology extraction was origi- 
nally proposed by Marti Hearst [5], who introduced the use of lexico-syntactic 
patterns for the extraction of hyponymic relationships. Hearst’s method has since 
then been followed by the most successful systems, such as the Espresso system 
proposed by Pennacchiotti and Pantel [6], based on bootstrapping.
   Aside from this pattern-based approach, new clustering methods have also 
been investigated. The main idea is to group terms that appear in the same kind 
of context and label the resulting clusters. The process yields natural hyponymic 
relations between the members of the cluster and its label. The clustering ap- 
proach was pioneered by Caraballo [2] who used conjunction and apposition to 
form new clusters.
   Other methods attempt to do away with prior text processing on the basis 
that, as the size of the corpus increases, syntactic processing is not sustainable. 
Ravichandran and Hovy[7] propose a pattern matching algorithm for question 
answering systems,  which relies  on the  direct use  of the  surface form of the 
corpus.
   Our work takes  an approach similar  to  those  investigated  by Hearst  and 
Pantel: patterns containing a binary relation of interest are applied to the corpus 
to  extract  instances.  However, the  method uses prior  syntactic  and semantic 
processing at a deeper level than the techniques described above.1

3    Using RMRS for Ontology Extraction


3.1    An Introduction to  RMRS

RMRS[4] is a development of Minimal Recursion Semantics [3]. One of its main 
features is its compatibility with both shallow and deep parsers, making it ver- 
satile enough for a wide range of applications: for the work reported here, we 
use RMRS  structures derived from parses produced by RASP3 (Robust Accu- 
rate  Statistical  Parser  [1]). RMRS allows  for semantic  underspecification  and 
is robust in that a structure is produced even for partial parses. In the worst 
case, a (highly underspecified) RMRS can be constructed from POS-tagged data 
alone. Thus structurally deficient analyses can still yield correct ontological re- 
lationships as long as a connection can be found between the two elements of a 
pair.
   For this work, we use a compiled form of RMRS in which each sentence in the 
corpus corresponds to a series of minimal trees. Each tree has a root, which is one 
of the lemmas in the sentence, and one or more daughters, the first one of which 
is the index of the lemma (the other daughters being potential arguments). As 
well as the argument trees, ‘in-group’ relations, denoted here by the tag ‘INGS’, 
express conjunction. The elements  of the  trees  and in-group relations  can be 
co-indexed to reconstruct the whole sentence or, if the complete parse is not 
available, phrases in the sentence. An example is shown in Fig. 1.

are not shown. Three trees are identified by the rectangular frames.



parser of roughly similar  depth  to the one we use, but they rely on syntactically- 
labelled relations. In principle, the RMRS approach has the advantage that it allows 
more abstraction  from irrelevant  details  of syntax  and also that  it is  possible  to 
switch between parsers without modification to the extraction code, and indeed to 
use merged results from more than one parser. See [4] for further discussion.



3.2    Corpus Preparation

The Wikipedia corpus is available as various database dumps in XML  format. 
The dump used in this work was released on 22nd April  2006 and includes the 
most  up-to-date  versions  of all pages, without  edit  history  or pictures,  at  the 
date of the dump creation. 12,200 animal articles were extracted from the dump 
and preprocessed  so that only text information remained. The resulting pages 
were parsed using RASP3 [1] and the RASP-RMRS converter [4] was applied to 
the derivations to obtain the RMRS.
   The core  of our system  is  a collection of classes that  extracts  and records 
RMRS trees, as described in §3.1, out of the original RMRS parse. The resulting 
representation forms the basis of ontology extraction.


3.3    System  Design

An initial, manual annotation of 100 articles in the corpus showed that 50% of 
pages started with the simplest hyponymic relation: A is-a B, where A is the 
first argument and B the second argument of the identity copula. In order to test 
the capabilities of RMRS extraction, our system was designed to systematically 
process such relationships and a number of common variations such  as A is a 
species of B or A is a B species in the C family. The patterns covered by the 
system are:

1. A is a B
2. A is a B species (or other taxonomic vocabulary)
3. A is a species of B (or other taxonomic vocabulary)
4. any of the above but with a ‘one of ’ construct inserted prior to the hypernym
(e.g., the gecko is one of several species of lizards.)

   An assumption was made as to the directionality of the hyponymic relation- 
ship: the cases where  the hypernym is indicated by the subject of the identity 
copula (one of the  most  common species  of felines  is  the  cat) were considered 
infrequent enough to bypass their separate treatment at this stage.
   The patterns above required the identification of taxonomic vocabulary. Con- 
tributors to Wikipedia consistently follow the Linnaean scientific classification. 
There are seven levels in the Linnaean hierarchy (kingdom, phylum, class, order, 
family, genus and species); those levels were recorded in a vocabulary file for fu- 
ture use, together with a few variations and additional terms commonly seen in 
the articles’ introductions.
   The algorithm processes each corpus sentence in four steps and fully utilises 
the argument structure and relational blocks of the RMRS. For conciseness, the 
following gives the skeleton of the code only but provides at each step the list of 
RMRS features used.

1. Identify RMRS trees headed by the identity copula.
ARG1 = base for hyponym
ARG2 = base for hypernym



Store ARG1 and ARG2 terms in arrays h and H.
2. Resolve ‘one-of’ constructs:
with: one INGS of
then: of ARG1 x (replace ‘one’ with x in H.)
3. Resolve taxonomic terms T:
with: ‘of’ trees (of ARG1 T ARG2 resolution)
or: adjective trees (resolution ARG1 T)
4. Expand hyponym and hypernym:
with: compound_rel, named_rel and adjective trees (JJ ARG1 NN).

The results of this process are potential hyponymic relations, which may refer to 
any kind of entity, not only animal organisms. A simple Named Entity Recog- 
nition method implemented by lexicon lookup was applied to the results to filer 
them. The NER lexicon was automatically constructed by recording the titles of 
all articles in the corpus. Truncation was systematically applied to both terms of 
the relation in order to extract terms such as wild cat out of the phrase a small 
wild cat.


4    Results and Evaluation

4.1    Evaluation Measures

Four evaluation measures were trialled, covering traditional calculations such as 
manual precision over a subset of the corpus as well as less common methods 
such  as manual recall. The following describes  all four heuristics.  The Gold 
Standard used throughout the evaluation was the NCBI online taxonomy (http:
//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Taxonomy).

1. Manual recall. Recall was calculated over a subset of the corpus. 100 arti- 
cles were read by one annotator and each relevant hyponymy recorded, to- 
gether with its originating sentence. 194 relationships were found and covered 
the use of syntactic patterns such  as constructs depending on the identity 
copula, apposition, punctuation and full inclusion verbs (include, comprise, 
etc). The manual recall score is thus the number of unique pairs extracted 
from the subset divided by 194.2
2. ‘Rough’ recall.  This  recall figure  reflects how many pairs  were found in
relation  to  the  number of articles  considered.  Using  the  figures compiled 
for manual recall calculation, it was estimated that each article contained 
roughly two  unique taxonomic  relationships.  The rough recall was simply 
the number of unique pairs divided by twice the number of articles.
3. Manual precision evaluation. Manual precision was calculated over 100
pairs randomly extracted from the results. The aim was to check the actual 
truth of the extracted relations rather than just their correspondence to the 
originating sentences. The scoring scheme was therefore designed to take into 
account the reliability of the sources used in checking:

2
Due to time constraints, evaluation was performed by one annotator only: we hope
to remedy this in future work.



(a) If the  pair is  found in the  NCBI database  or on the  site  of a scien- 
tific/academic organisation, score +1
(b)  If the pair is found on any other site, score +0.5
(c) If the pair is not found, score 0.
Wikipedia mirrors and Wikipedia itself did not count as sources.
4. Automatic precision evaluation. Manual annotation is very time-consuming, 
but the repeated use of a very small set of manual annotations for system 
development carries a high risk of over-fitting. So a program was written to 
compare all pairs  in the  results  with  the  NCBI database.  The number of 
pairs found gives a ‘minimal precision’ figure which was used in devlopment
to investigate the relative precision of different versions of the system.


4.2    Results

Running the initial system on the whole corpus resulted in 3985 relations being 
extracted,  giving a 16.5% ‘rough’ recall figure. Manual recall yielded a 14% 
figure. RMRS gave promising results in the treatment of complex structures and 
long distance dependencies. Some examples of the relationships extracted by our 
system are shown below:

1. The Cottontop Tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), also known as the Pinchu Tamarin, 
is  a small  New World  monkey weighing less  than  1lb (0.5 kg): cottontop 
tamarin is-a new world monkey
2. The Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus (also called Dublin Bay prawn or
langoustine), is a slim orange-pink lobster found in the north-eastern Atlantic
Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea: norway lobster is-a lobster
3. Opah (also known colloquially as moonfish,  sunfish, kingfish, and Jerusalem 
haddock) are large, colourful, deep-bodied pelagic Lampriform fish compris- 
ing the small family Lampridae (also spelt Lamprididae): opah is-a fish

   The precision, as calculated over 100 randomly chosen pairs was 92% – the 
errors and partially verified pairs (scored as 0.5) are shown below:

Out of six  incorrect pairs,  two  resulted  from the  inverted  ‘hypernym is-a  hy- 
ponym’ pattern  mentioned  in §3.3 not  being catered  for. As  non-experts,  we



cannot be completely certain whether the Wikipedia entries are correct or not, 
since even if we find supporting evidence on another site, we cannot be sure that 
site is correct. But these results show no evidence of unreliability in Wikipedia. 
The use of wild cat in the jaguarundi article to refer to species other than do- 
mestic cats and big cats is perhaps an infelicity, given that it also refers to a 
specific species, but is not an error.
   Applying  the  automatic  evaluation  to  the  results  yielded a score  of 44%, 
i.e. less than half of the relations could be verified against the NCBI database. 
Inspection of the evaluation output file revealed that 1757 hypernyms were not 
found in the NCBI names list. This was indicative of the potential usefulness of 
ontology extraction in this domain, even though large-scale ontologies already 
exist.


4.3    Evaluation

The main problem with our system is obviously the low recall. Several factors 
contribute to explain this result:

1. Some  correct pairs  are  lost  when checking the  terms  against  the  animal 
lexicon (the list is not comprehensive enough).
2. Incomplete parses affect the final result.
3. The number of extraction  rules is  small.  Expanding the  rules to  include 
verbs such as encompass,  comprise, etc should provide a broader basis for 
extraction.


Lexicon Issues  In order to ascertain the shortcomings of the lexicon, the first
250 pairs found by the system were printed out prior to any term matching being 
performed, i.e. non-taxonomic pairs were part of the set. A manual check revealed 
that out of those 250 pairs, 34 taxonomic pairs were already being extracted by 
the system but 23 additional pairs contained possible valid taxonomic names as 
their hyponym and hypernym, yielding a potential 67% increase on the number 
of relations extracted in that particular section of the corpus.
There were four main reasons for relations being lost during list lookup:

1. The search term did appear in Wikipedia but under a variant (for instance, 
theropod is not an article but theropoda is. Hence only theropoda was listed 
in the lexicon.)
2. The term did not appear in Wikipedia at all.
3. The parser had not transformed a plural noun into its singular equivalent, 
leading to a search failure.
4. Compounds were being extracted with the wrong word order.

   An  attempt  was  made at  remedying to  the  lexicon’s  shortcomings  using 
Wikipedia redirections. It was hoped that recording all animal redirections would 
provide a comprehensive list of the noun variants used in the encyclopaedia. Over
1M redirection pages were extracted from the dump and 21,531 animal entries



recorded. The system was expanded with a redirection checking stage and plural 
noun processing. The compound issue was solved by ensuring that terms were 
concatenated in their order of appearance in the RMRS. The modified program 
yielded 4771 pairs, or a 20% increase on the original figure, pushing the rough 
recall figure to 20%. Manual precision dropped slightly to 88.5%.


Partial  Parses  Issue  An inspection of the  RMRS file  for the  subset used 
at manual recall stage showed that many instances of ‘be’ in that part of the 
corpus were contained in partial parses and missing argument values: out of 194 
potential pairs, 97 depended on the identity copula. Out of those 97, 41 were 
missing an argument altogether or an argument value, indicating that only about
29% of the manually extracted pairs were recoverable. This issue would be partly 
solvable by expanding the set of rules responsible for converting the syntactic 
parse into an RMRS parse. The other avenue to explore is the syntactic parse 
itself. This work only considers the first parse obtained from RASP. Sometime 
errors occur in parts of the parse that indicate the taxonomic relationship. This 
might be addressed by processing the n-best parses from the RASP output, 
rather than just the first, although there are cases where the correct parse is not 
found at all, or has very low rank. In the longer term, we intend to investigate 
the use of deeper parsing in conjunction with RASP.


Rule Coverage  This initial system is restricted by the limited number of pat- 
terns considered during extraction. The next section describes how we have 
started  implementing  a new system  that  automatically  extracts  RMRS rules 
out of a training set and applies them to our corpus to discover new instances. 
This  new design ensures that  patterns  are  kept separate  from the  extraction 
module and shows potential in increasing recall by using a wider variety of rules.


5    A First Attempt at Automatic Pattern Extraction

5.1    Defining the RMRS Pattern

Let A and B be two English terms. A and B are known at training stage (they 
are the training instances) and unknown at pattern matching stage (they are the 
new pairs extracted by the system). The RMRS pattern is the path linking A 
and B through the RMRS representation of the sentence. A path is an ordered 
set of unique coindexed RMRS trees. Each RMRS tree consists of either a lemma 
with all its identifiable arguments or an INGS relation. No loop is allowed in the 
path. An example is shown below:

LEMMA::be ARG1::A ARG2::member|LEMMA::member ARG1::group| 
LEMMA::compound_rel ARG1::group ARG2::B

The pattern  in the  example consists  of three  trees.  The ARG2 of the  first  is 
co-indexed with the lemma of the second. The ARG1 of the second is co-indexed 
with the ARG1 of the third. A is the hyponym and B is the hypernym.



   The hyponymic relationship  may correspond to  one or more patterns,  de- 
pending on whether it contains compounds or not. Relational patterns (the core 
of the hyponymy) and compound patterns are extracted and stored separately. 
So for instance,  the  training  pair ‘yellow-bellied elaenia is-a  bird’  leads to  a 
relational pattern linking ‘elaenia’ and ‘bird’  and a compound pattern linking
‘yellow-bellied ’ and ‘elaenia’. Two assumptions were made here:

1. The last word of a compound, and the last word only, constitutes the hy- 
ponym or hypernym’s core.
2. In the  case  of multiple  element  compounds (Northern  Brown Bandicoot), 
each adjective/qualifying noun modifies the main noun, i.e. the last word in 
the compound. (This is a simplification.)


5.2    Initial Experiments

Using the definition given above, the first iteration of our new system was run 
over a training set consisting of the 194 pairs manually obtained from the cor- 
pus when performing manual recall calculations. 32 relational patterns and 24 
compound patterns  were extracted.  These  figures are  small  compared to  the 
size of the training set, but error evaluation shows that the extraction failures 
are  due to  issues  that  could be fixed in further  work. The incomplete  RMRS 
rule set is once again the main problem. In particular rules were not available 
to treat apposition of the type The Northern Brown Bandicoot, a marsupial 
species,  is  a bandicoot. . .  or noun plus qualifier constructions  of the  type  the 
family Drepanidae. Wikipedia articles frequently omit commas round apposi- 
tions, which prevented their recognition. Slight tuning or retraining of the parser 
should improve performance.
   The experiments also demonstrated the necessity for a targeted or sufficiently 
large training set. The rules we extracted in these preliminary experiments did 
not cover all potential taxonomic terms such as family, genus or species. Some 
over-specific lexical items were also observed on the patterns’ paths.
   In order to get an indication of the potential in RMRS pattern extraction, we 
replaced extracted taxonomic terms with the generalised dummy entry ‘taxovoc’ 
in the rules and changed all over-specific lexical entries into general equivalents. 
We then run a pattern matching algorithm over the resulting rules. This yielded 
a large increase in recall with 9142 unique pairs being extracted: a 37% rough 
recall. Manual precision, however, was only 64.5% while the automatic minimum 
precision figure fell to 30%. A systematic rule evaluation showed the presence of 
highly imprecise patterns, highlighting the need for a thorough automatic rule 
evaluation method in further iterations of the system development.


6    Conclusion and Further Work

This  work attempted  to  move away from the  traditional  regular expression- 
based approaches in ontology extraction by using a semantic framework. It was



shown that RMRS offers advantages in terms of tackling structural complexities. 
Applying a systematic treatment of the identity copula’s arguments to a corpus 
consisting of 12,200 Wikipedia articles resulted in 4771 taxonomic relationships 
being extracted: roughly 20% of the available pairs, yielding 88.5% precision.
   These promising initial results call for the development of a more complete 
system, including pattern extraction and pattern matching features. Some trials 
with automatic rule extraction were reported here, showing a large potential for 
recall increase balanced with a need for a thorough pattern evaluation method.
   Further work will focus on implementing such a system and will attempt to 
resolve  the  issues  highlighted  in this  paper. In particular,  it is  expected that 
expanding the  set of syntactic-to-semantic  conversion  rules in the  RMRS and 
running the  system  on different  syntactic  parses  might  produce a significant 
improvement in recall without affecting the precision. Other domains (chemistry 
being a possible choice) will also be investigated in order to show whether RMRS 
can be used in a general purpose tool.
