			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Minimum Error Rate Training emerged a decade ago (Och, 2003) as a superior training method for small numbers of linear model parameters of machine translation systems, improving over prior work using maximum likelihood criteria (Och and Ney, 2002).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">This technique quickly rose to prominence, becoming standard in many research and commercial MT systems.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">Variants operating over lattices (Macherey et al., 2008) or hypergraphs (Kumar et al., 2009) were subsequently developed, with the benefit of reducing the approximation error from n-best lists.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">The primary advantages of MERT are twofold.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">It directly optimizes the evaluation metric under consideration (e.g., BLEU) instead of some surrogate loss.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Secondly, it offers a globally optimal line search.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Unfortunately, there are several potential difficulties in scaling MERT to larger numbers of features, due to its non-convex loss function and its lack of regularization.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">These challenges have prompted some researchers to move away from MERT, in favor of linearly decomposable approximations of the evaluation metric (Chiang et al., 2009; Hopkins and May, 2011; Cherry and Foster, 2012), which correspond to easier optimization problems and which naturally incorporate regularization.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">In particular, recent work (Chiang et al., 2009) has shown that adding thousands or tens of thousands of features can improve MT quality when weights are optimized using a margin-based approximation.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">On simulated datasets, Hopkins and May (2011) found that conventional MERT struggles to find reasonable parameter vectors, where a smooth loss function based on Pairwise Ranking Optimization (PRO) performs much better; on real data, this PRO method appears at least as good as MERT on small feature sets, and also scales better as the number of features increases.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">In this paper, we seek to preserve the advantages of MERT while addressing its shortcomings in terms of regularization and search.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">The idea of adding a regularization term to the MERT objective function can be perplexing at first, because the most common regularizers, such as £1 and £2, are not directly applicable to MERT.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">Indeed, these regularizers are scale sensitive, while the MERT objective function is not: scaling the weight vector neither changes the predictions of the linear model nor affects the error count.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">Hence, MERT can hedge any regularization penalty by maximally scaling down linear model weights.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">The first contribution of this paper is to analyze various forms of regularization that are not susceptible to this scaling problem.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">We analyze and experiment with £0, a form of regularization that is scale insensitive.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">We also present new parameterizations of £2 regularization, where we apply £2 regularization to scale-senstive linear transforms of the original linear model.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">In addition, we introduce efficient methods set of reference translations rS = {r1 . . .</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">rS }.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">This yields the following optimization problem: of incorporating regularization in Och (2003)’s exact line searches.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">For all of these regularizers, our methods let us find the true optimum of the regularized wˆ = arg min w S )&apos; E(rs, ˆe(fs; w)) = s=1 S M objective function along the line.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">arg min )&apos; )&apos; E(rs, e s,m )δ(e s,m , ˆe(fs; w)) Finally, we address the issue of searching in a high-dimensional space by using the gradient of expected BLEU (Smith and Eisner, 2006) to find better w where s=1 m=1 (1) search directions for our line searches.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">This direction finder addresses one of the serious concerns raised by Hopkins and May (2011): MERT widely failed to reach the optimum of a synthetic linear objective function.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">In replicating Hopkins and May’s experiments, we confirm that existing search algorithms for MERT—including coordinate ascent, Powell’s algorithm (Powell, 1964), and random direction sets (Cer et al., 2008)—perform poorly in this experimental condition.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "32">However, when using our gradient-based direction finder, MERT has no problem finding the true optimum even in a 1000-dimensional space.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "33">Our results suggest that the combination of a regularized objective function and a gradient-informed line search algorithm enables MERT to scale well with a large number of features.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "34">Experiments with up to 3600 features show that these extensions of MERT yield results comparable to PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011), a parameter tuning method known to be effective with large feature sets.</S>

			<S sid ="35" ssid = "1">Prior to introducing regularized MERT, we briefly review standard unregularized MERT (Och, 2003).</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "2">ˆe(fs; w) = arg max w hs,m (2) m∈{1...M } While the error surface of Equation 1 is only an approximation of the true error surface of the MT decoder, the quality of this approximation depends on the size of the hypothesis space represented by the M -best list.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "3">Therefore, the hypothesis list is grown iteratively: decoding with an initial parameter vector seeds the M -best lists; next, parameter estimation and M -best list gathering alternate until the cumulative M -best list no longer grows, or until changes of w between two decoding runs are deemed too small.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "4">To increase the size of the hypothesis space, subsequent work (Macherey et al., 2008) instead operated on lattices, but this paper focuses on M -best lists.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "5">A crucial observation is that the unsmoothed error count represented in Equation 1 is a piecewise constant function.</S>

			<S sid ="68" ssid = "10">2 The £2 regularizer is often used in conjunction with log- likelihood objectives.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "11">The regularization term of Equation 4 could similarly be added to the log of an objective—e.g., log(BLEU) instead of BLEU—but we found that the distinction doesn’t have much of an impact in practice.</S>

			<S sid ="71" ssid = "13">Geometrically, £2 is a parabola, £1 is the wedge- shaped absolute value function, and £0 is an impulse function with a spike at 0.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "14">The original formulation (Equation 1) of MERT consists of a piecewise constant representation of the loss, as a function of the step size in a given direction.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "15">But with these three reg ularization terms, the function respectively becomes piecewise quadratic, piecewise linear, or piecewise constant with a potential impulse jump for each distinct choice of regularizer.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "16">Figure 1 demonstrates this effect graphically.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "17">As discussed in (McAllester and Keshet, 2011), the problem with optimizing Equation 4 directly is that the output of the underlying linear classifier, and therefore the error count, are not sensitive to the scale of w. Moreover, £2 regularization (as well as £1 regularization) is scale sensitive, which means any op timizer of this function can drive the regularization Section 2, but the other aspects of MERT remain the same, and we can still use global search algorithms such as coordinate ascent, Powell, and random directions exactly the same way as with unregularized MERT.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "18">Line search with a regularization term is still as efficient as in (Och, 2003), and it is still guaranteed to find the optimum of the (now regularized) objective function along the line.</S>

			<S sid ="82" ssid = "24">The requirement that this feature set be small is to prevent overfitting.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "25">Otherwise, any regularization toward an overfit parameter vector w0 would defeat the purpose of introducing a regularization term in the first place.3 In (2), the transformation is motivated by the observation that the D-parameter linear model of Equation 2 only needs (D − 1) degrees of freedom.</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "26">Fixing one of the components of w to any nonzero constant and now is that the error count on each segment [γi−1, γi] is no longer constant.</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "27">This means we need to adjust the final step of line search, which consists of enumerating all [γi−1, γi], and keeping the optimum of Equation 5 for each segment.</S>

			<S sid ="87" ssid = "29">The optimum is either at the left edge, the right edge, or in the middle if the vertex of the parabola happens to lie within that segment.4 We compute this optimum by finding the value γ for which the derivative of the regularization term is zero.</S>

			<S sid ="136" ssid = "22">Finally the per-sentence envelopes are merged into a global representation of the loss along that direction.</S>
			<S sid ="137" ssid = "23">Our implementation successively merges adjacent pairs of piecewise smooth loss function representations until a single list remains.</S>
			<S sid ="138" ssid = "24">These log S passes lead to a merging runtime of O(SM log S).</S>
			<S sid ="139" ssid = "25">The time required to compute a gradient is proportional to O(SM D).</S>
			<S sid ="140" ssid = "26">For each sentence, we first gather the probability and its gradient, then use this to compute expected n-gram counts and matches as wellas those gradients in time O(M D).</S>
			<S sid ="141" ssid = "27">A constant num ber of arithmetic operations suffice to compute the final expected loss value and its gradient.</S>
			<S sid ="142" ssid = "28">Therefore, computing the gradient does not increase the algorithmic complexity when compared to conventional approaches using coordinate ascent and random directions.</S>
			<S sid ="143" ssid = "29">Likewise the runtime of a single iteration is competitive with PRO, given that gradient finding is generally the most expensive part of convex optimization.</S>
			<S sid ="144" ssid = "30">Of course, it is difficult to compare overall runtime of convex optimization with that of MERT, as we know of no way to bound the number of gradient evaluations required for convergence with MERT.</S>
			<S sid ="145" ssid = "31">Therefore, we resort to empirical comparison later in the paper, and find that the two methods appear to have comparable runtime.</S>
			<S sid ="146" ssid = "32">6 In the special case where the difference between the prior direction and the current direction is sparse, we may update the individual linear functions in time proportional to the number of changed dimensions.</S>
			<S sid ="147" ssid = "33">Coordinate ascent in particular can update the linear functions in time O(SM ): to the intercept of the equation for each translation, we may add the prior step size multiplied by the feature value in the prior coordinate, and the slope becomes the feature value in the new coordinate.</S>
			<S sid ="148" ssid = "34">However, this optimization does not appear to be widely adopted, likely because it does not lead to any speedup when random vectors, conjugate directions, or other non-sparse directions are used.</S>
			<S sid ="149" ssid = "35">Table 1: Datasets for the two experimental conditions.</S>
			<S sid ="150" ssid = "36">5 Experimental Design.</S>
			<S sid ="151" ssid = "37">Following Hopkins and May (2011), our experimental setup utilizes both real and synthetic data.</S>
			<S sid ="152" ssid = "38">The motivation for using synthetic data is that it is a way of gauging the quality of optimization methods, since the data is constructed knowing the global optimum.</S>
			<S sid ="153" ssid = "39">Hopkins and May also note that the use of an objective function that is linear in some gold weight vector makes the search much simpler than in a real translation setting, and they suggest that a learner that performs poorly in such a simple scenario has little hope of succeeding in a more complex one.</S>
			<S sid ="154" ssid = "40">The setup of our synthetic data experiment is almost the same as that performed by Hopkins and May (2011).</S>
			<S sid ="155" ssid = "41">We generate feature vectors of dimensionality ranging from 10 to 1000.</S>
			<S sid ="156" ssid = "42">These features are generated by drawing random numbers uniformly in the interval [0, 500].</S>
			<S sid ="157" ssid = "43">This synthetic dataset consists of S=1000 source “sentences”, and M=500 “translation” hypotheses for each sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="158" ssid = "44">A pseudo “BLEU” score is then computed for each hypothesis, by computing the dot product between a prede fined gold weight vector w∗ and each feature vector hs,m. By this linear construction, w∗ is guaranteed to be a global optimum.7 The pseudo-BLEU score is normalized for each M -best list, so that the translation with highest model score according to w∗ has a BLEU score of 1, and so that the translation with lowest model score for the sentence gets a BLEU of zero.</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "45">This normalization has no impact on search, but makes results more interpretable.</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "46">For our translation experiments, we use multi- stack phrase-based decoding (Koehn et al., 2007).</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "47">We report results for two feature sets: non-linear features induced using Gradient Boosting Machines (Toutanova and Ahn, 2013) and sparse lexicalized 7 The objective function remains piecewise constant, and the plateau containing w∗ maps to the optimal value of the function.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "48">feature sets (GBM and SparseHRM, respectively) in two distinct experimental conditions, which we detail in the two next paragraphs.</S>
			<S sid ="163" ssid = "49">Both GBM and SparseHRM augment baseline features similar to Moses’: relative frequency and lexicalized phrase translation scores for both translation directions; one or two language model features, depending on the language pair; distortion penalty; word and phrase count; six lexicalized reordering features.</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "50">For both experimental conditions, phrase tables have maximum phrase length of 7 words on either side.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "51">In reference to Table 1, we used the training set (Train) for extracting phrase tables and language models; the Tune set for optimization with MERT or PRO; the Dev set for selecting hyperparameters of PRO and regularized MERT; and the Test set for reporting final results.</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "52">In each experimental condition, we first trained weights for the base feature sets, and then decoded the Tune, Dev, and Test datasets, generating 500-best lists for each set.</S>
			<S sid ="167" ssid = "53">All results report reranking performance on these lists with different feature sets and optimization methods, based on lower-cased BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001).</S>
			<S sid ="168" ssid = "54">The GBM feature set (Toutanova and Ahn, 2013) consists of about 230 features automatically induced using decision tree weak learners, which derive features using various word-level, phrase-level, and morphological attributes.</S>
			<S sid ="169" ssid = "55">For ChineseEnglish, the training corpus consists of approximately one million sentence pairs from the FBIS and Hong Kong portions of the LDC data for the NIST MT evaluation and the Tune and Test sets are from NIST competitions.</S>

			<S sid ="171" ssid = "57">For FinnishEnglish we used a dataset from a technical domain of software manuals.</S>
			<S sid ="172" ssid = "58">For this language pair we used two language models: one very large model trained on billions of words, and another language model trained from the target side of the parallel training set.</S>
			<S sid ="173" ssid = "59">The SparseHRM set (Cherry, 2013) contains 3600 sparse reordering features.</S>
			<S sid ="174" ssid = "60">For each phrase, the features take the form of indicators describing its orientation in the derivation, and its lexical content in terms of word clusters or frequent words.</S>

			<S sid ="183" ssid = "1">We conducted experiments with the synthetic data scenario described in the previous section, as well as with noise added to the data (Hopkins and May, 2011).</S>
			<S sid ="184" ssid = "2">The purpose of adding noise is to make the optimization task more realistic.</S>
			<S sid ="185" ssid = "3">Specifically, after computing all pseudo-BLEU scores, we added noise to each feature vector hs,m by drawing from a zero-mean Gaussian with standard deviation 200.</S>
			<S sid ="186" ssid = "4">effectiveness is also visible with noisy data, as seen in Figure 2.</S>
			<S sid ="187" ssid = "5">The decrease of its cosine is relatively small compared to other search algorithms, and this decrease is not necessarily a sign of search errors since the addition of noise causes the true optimum to be different from w∗.</S>
			<S sid ="188" ssid = "6">Finally, Figure 3 shows our rate of convergence compared to coordinate ascent.</S>
			<S sid ="189" ssid = "7">Our experimental results with the GBM feature set data are shown in Table 2.</S>
			<S sid ="190" ssid = "8">Each table is divided into three sections corresponding respectively to MERT (Och, 2003) with Koehn-style coordinate ascent (Koehn, 2004), PRO, and our optimizer featuring both regularization and the gradient-based direction finder.</S>
			<S sid ="191" ssid = "9">All variants of MERT are initialized with a single starting point, which is either uniform weight or w0.</S>
			<S sid ="192" ssid = "10">Instead of providing MERT with additional random starting points as in Moses, we use random walks as in (Moore and Quirk, 2008) to attempt to move out of local optima.8 Since PRO and our optimizer have hyperparameters, we use a held-out set (Dev) for adjusting them.</S>
			<S sid ="193" ssid = "11">For PRO, we adjust three parameters: a regularization penalty for £2, the parameter α in the add-α smoothed sentence-level version of BLEU (Lin and Och, 2004), and a parameter for scaling the corpus-level length of the references.</S>
			<S sid ="194" ssid = "12">The latter scaling parameter is discussed in (He and Our results with both noiseless and noisy data yield the same conclusion as Hopkins and May: standard MERT struggles with many dimensions, and fails to recover w∗.</S>

			<S sid ="230" ssid = "48">However, since PRO optimizes translation length on the Dev dataset and MERT does so using the Tune set, a comparison of the two systems would yield a discrepancy in length that would be undesirable.</S>
			<S sid ="231" ssid = "49">Therefore, we add another hyperparameter to regularized MERT to tune length in the same manner using the Dev set.</S>
			<S sid ="232" ssid = "50">Table 2 offers several findings.</S>
			<S sid ="233" ssid = "51">First, unregularized MERT can achieve competitive results with a small set of highly engineered features, but adding a large set of more than 200 features causes MERT to (though coordinate ascent is slower due to its lack of a good direction finder), but our method seems more robust with suboptimal regularization parameters.</S>
			<S sid ="234" ssid = "52">Our results with the SparseHRM feature set data are shown in Table 3.</S>
			<S sid ="235" ssid = "53">As with the GBM feature set, we find again that the version of £2 MERT regular ized towards ||w − w0|| is competitive with PRO, even though we train MERT with a large set of 3601 features.9 One remaining question is whether MERT remains practical with large feature sets.</S>
			<S sid ="236" ssid = "54">As noted in the complexity analysis of Section 4.3, MERT has a dependence on the number of features that is comparable to PRO, i.e., it is linear in both cases.</S>
			<S sid ="237" ssid = "55">Practically, we find that optimization time is comparable between the two systems.</S>
			<S sid ="238" ssid = "56">In the case of ChineseEnglish for the GBM feature set, one run of the PRO optimizer took 26 minutes on average, while regularized MERT with the gradient direction finder took 37 minutes on average, taking into account the time to compute w0.</S>
			<S sid ="239" ssid = "57">In the case of ChineseEnglish for the SparseHRM feature set, average optimization times for PRO and our method were 3.10 hours and 3.84 hours on average, respectively.</S>

			<S sid ="271" ssid = "23">MERT and its extensions have been the target of extensive research (Och, 2003; Macherey et al., 2008; Cer et al., 2008; Moore and Quirk, 2008; Kumar et al., 2009; Galley and Quirk, 2011).</S>
			<S sid ="272" ssid = "24">More recent work has focused on replacing MERT with a linearly decomposable approximations of the evaluation metric (Smith and Eisner, 2006; Liang et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008; Hopkins and May, 2011; Rosti et al., 2011; Gimpel and Smith, 2012; Cherry and Foster, 2012), which generally involve a surrogate loss function incorporating a regularization term such as the £2-norm.</S>
			<S sid ="273" ssid = "25">While we are not aware of any previous work adding a penalty on the weights in the context of MERT, (Cer et al., 2008) achieves a related effect.</S>
