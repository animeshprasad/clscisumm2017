Abstract

This paper presents an open and flexible method- 
ological framework for the automatic acquisition of 
multiword expressions (MWEs) from monolingual 
textual corpora. This research is motivated by the 
importance of MWEs for NLP applications.  Af- 
ter briefly presenting the modules of the framework, 
the paper reports extrinsic evaluation results con- 
sidering two applications: computer-aided lexicog- 
raphy and statistical machine translation. Both ap- 
plications can benefit from automatic MWE acquisi- 
tion and the expressions acquired automatically from 
corpora can both speed up and improve  their quality. 
The promising results of previous and ongoing ex- 
periments encourage further investigation about the 
optimal way to integrate MWE treatment into these 
and many other applications.


1   Introduction

Multiword  expressions  (MWEs)  range over linguistic 
constructions  such as idioms (to pay an arm and a leg), 
fixed phrases (rock ’n’  roll)  and noun compounds (dry 
ice). There is no unique and widely accepted definition 
for the term multiword expression.  It can be an “arbi- 
trary and recurrent word combination” (Smadja, 1993) 
or “a syntactic and semantic unit whose exact and un- 
ambiguous meaning or connotation cannot be derived di- 
rectly from the meaning or connotation of its compo- 
nents” (Choueka, 1988) or simply an “idiosyncratic inter- 
pretation that crosses word boundaries (or spaces)” (Sag 
et al., 2002). MWEs lie in the fuzzy zone between lexi- 
con and syntax, thus constituting a real challenge for NLP 
systems.  In addition, they are very pervasive, occurring 
frequently in everyday  language as well as in specialised 
communications. Some common properties of MWEs 
are:1
  1 These are not binary yes/no flags, but values in a continuum going 
from flexible word combinations to prototypical fixed expressions.

• Arbitrariness: sometimes valid constructions are 
not acceptable  because people do not use them. 
Smadja (1993, p. 143–144) illustrates this by pre- 
senting 8 different ways of referring to the Dow 
Jones index, among which only 4 are used.
• Institutionalisation:  MWEs are recurrent,  as they 
correspond to conventional ways of saying things. 
Jackendoff (1997) estimates that they compose half of 
the entries of a speaker’s  lexicon, and Sag et al. 
(2002) point out that this may be an underestimate if 
we consider domain-specific MWEs.
• Limited semantic variability: MWEs do not un- 
dergo the same semantic  compositionality rules as 
ordinary word combinations. This is expressed in 
terms of (i) non-compositionality,  as the meaning of 
the whole expression often cannot be directly in- 
ferred from the meaning of the parts composing it, 
(ii) non-substitutability,  as it is not possible to re- 
place part of an MWE by a related (synonym/equiv- 
alent) word or construction,  and (iii) no word-for- 
word translation.

• Limited syntactic variability: standard grammati- 
cal rules do not apply to MWEs.  This can be ex- 
pressed in terms of (i) lexicalisation,   as one can- 
not list all MWEs in the lexicon (undergeneration) 
nor include them all in the grammar (overgenera- 
tion) and (ii) extragrammaticality,  as MWEs are 
unpredictable and seem “weird”  for a second  lan- 
guage learner who only knows general rules.2
• Heterogeneity:  MWEs are hard to define because 
they encompass   a  large amount of  phenomena. 
Thus, NLP applications cannot use a  unified ap- 
proach and need to rely on some typology3 .

  In this paper, I adopt the definition by Calzolari et al. 
(2002), who define MWEs as:

different but related phenomena [which] can be 
described  as a sequence4  of words that acts as a 
single unit at some level of linguistic analysis.

  This generic and intentionally vague definition can be 
narrowed down according to the application needs. For 
example, for the statistical machine translation (MT) sys- 
tem5 used in the examples shown in Table 1, an MWE is 
any sequence of words which, when not translated  as a 
unit, generates errors: ungrammatical  or unnatural verbal 
constructions (sentence 1), awkward literal translations of 
idioms (sentence 2) and problems of lexical choice and 
word order in specialised texts (sentence 3).  These ex- 
amples illustrate the importance of correctly dealing with 
MWEs in MT applications and, more generally, MWEs 
can speed up and help remove ambiguities in many cur- 
rent NLP applications, for example:

• Lexicography: Church and Hanks (1990) used  a 
lexicographic  environment  as their evaluation sce- 
nario, comparing manual and intuitive research with 
the automatic association ratio they proposed.
• Word sense disambiguation:    MWEs tend to be 
less polysemous than simple words. Finlayson and 
Kulkarni (2011) exemplify that the word world has
9 senses in Wordnet 1.6, record has 14, but world 
record has only 1.
• POS tagging and parsing: recent work in parsing 
and POS tagging indicates that MWEs can help re- 
move syntactic ambiguities (Seretan, 2008).
• Information retrieval: when MWEs like pop star 
are indexed  as a unit, the accuracy of the system im- 
proves on multiword queries (Acosta et al., 2011).

2 Examples of MWEs that breach standard grammatical rules include
kingdom come and by and large.
    3 For example, Smadja (1993) classifies them according to syntactic 
function while Sag et al. (2002) classify them according to flexibility.


2   Thesis contributions

Despite the importance of MWEs in several applications, 
they are often neglected in the design and construction 
of real-life systems. In 1993, Smadja pointed out that 
“. . . although disambiguation  was originally considered 
as a performance task, the collocations retrieved have not 
been used for any specific computational task.”   Most 
of the recent and current research in the MWE commu- 
nity still focuses on MWE acquisition instead of integra- 
tion of automatically acquired or manually compiled re- 
sources into applications. The main contribution of my 
thesis is that it represents  a step toward the integration 
of automatically extracted MWEs into real-life applica- 
tions. Concretely, my contributions can be classified in 
two categories: first, I propose a unified, open and flexi- 
ble methodological framework (§ 3) for automatic MWE 
acquisition from corpora; and second, I am performing 
an intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of MWE acquisition 
(§ 4), dissecting the influence of the different types of re- 
sources employed in the acquisition on the quality of the 
MWEs. The results of ongoing experiments are interest- 
ing but further work is needed to better understand the 
contributions of MWEs to the systems (§ 5).

Methodological Framework   To  date,  there is  no 
agreement on whether there is a single best method for 
MWE acquisition, or whether a different subset of meth- 
ods works better for a given MWE type. Most of recent 
work on MWE treatment focuses on candidate extraction 
from preprocessed text (Seretan, 2008) and on the auto- 
matic filtering and ranking through association measures 
(Evert, 2004; Pecina, 2010), but few authors provide a 
whole picture of the MWE treatment pipeline.  One of 
the advantages of the framework I propose is that it mod- 
els the whole acquisition  process with modular tasks that 
can be chained in several ways, each task having multiple 
available techniques. Therefore, it is highly customisable 
and allows for a large number of parameters to be tuned 
according to the target MWE types. Moreover, the tech- 
niques I have developed do not depend on a fixed length 
of candidate expression nor on adjacency assumptions, 
as the words in an expression might occur several words 
away.   Thanks to this flexibility,  this methodology can 
be easily applied to virtually any language, MWE type 
and domain, not strictly depending on a given formal- 
ism or tool6 .  Intuitively, for a given language, if some 
preprocessing tools like POS taggers and/or parsers are 
available, the results will be much better than running the 
methods on raw text. But since such tools are not avail- 
able for all languages, the methodology was conceived to 
be applicable even in the absence of preprocessing.


4 Although they define MWEs as “sequences”, assuming contiguity,	 	


we assume “sets” of words for greater generality.

6 However, it is designed to deal with languages that use spaces to 
separate words. Thus, when working with Chinese, Japanese, or even 
with German compounds, some additional preprocessing is required.

sion (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001; Pearce, 2002; Evert and 
Krenn, 2005). On the one hand, the results of intrinsic 
evaluation are often vague or inconclusive: although they 
shed some light on the optimal parameters for the given 
scenario, they are hard to generalise and cannot be di- 
rectly applied to other configurations. The quality of ac- 
quired MWEs as measured by objective criteria depends 
on the language, domain and type of the target construc- 
tion, on corpus size and genre, on already available re- 
sources7 , on the applied filters, preprocessing steps, etc. 
On the other hand, extrinsic evaluation consists of insert-

acquisition on two study cases: computer-aided  lexicog- 
raphy and statistical machine translation. My goal is to 
investigate (1) how much the MWEs impact on the appli- 
cation and (2) what is (are) the best way(s) of integrating 
them in the complex pipeline of the target application.

3   MWE Extraction

Among early work on developing methods for MWE 
identification, there is that of Smadja (1993).  He pro- 
posed and developed a  tool  called Xtract,  aimed at 
general-purpose collocation extraction from text using a 
combination of n-grams  and a mutual information mea- 
sure. On general-purpose texts, Xtract has a precision  of 
around 80%. Since then, many advances have been made, 
either looking at MWEs in general (Dias, 2003), or focus- 
ing on specific MWE types, such as collocations,  phrasal 
verbs and compound nouns. A popular type-independent 
approach to MWE identification is to use statistical as- 
sociation measures, which have been applied to the task 
with varying degrees of success (Evert  and Krenn,  2005). 
One of the advantages of this approach is that it is lan- 
guage independent.  This is particularly important since 
although work on MWEs in several languages has been 
reported, e.g. Dias (2003) for Portuguese and Evert and 
Krenn (2005) for German, work on English still seems to 
predominate.
  I propose a new framework called mwetoolkit, de- 
scribed in Figure 1, which integrates multiple techniques 
and covers the whole pipeline of MWE acquisition. One 
can preprocess  a raw monolingual corpus, if tools are

available for the target language, enriching it with POS 
tags, lemmas and dependency syntax. Then, based on 
expert linguistic knowledge, intuition, empiric observa- 
tion and/or examples, one defines multilevel patterns in a 
formalism similar to regular expressions to describe the 
target MWEs. The application of these patterns on an in- 
dexed corpus  generates a list of candidate MWEs.  For 
filtering, a plethora of methods is available, ranging from 
simple frequency thresholds to stopword lists and sophis- 
ticated association measures. Finally, the resulting fil- 
tered candidates are either directly injected into an NLP 
application or further manually validated before applica- 
tion.  An alternative  use for the validated candidates is 
to train a machine learning  model which can be applied 
on new corpora in order to automatically identify and ex- 
tract MWEs based on the characteristics  of the previously 
acquired ones.  For further details, please refer to the 
website of the framework8 and to previous publications 
(Ramisch et al., 2010a; Ramisch et al., 2010b).

4   Application-oriented evaluation

In this section, I present summarised results of extrinsic 
quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the framework 
for MWE acquisition propose in § 3. The target applica- 
tions are computer-aided lexicography  (§ 4.1) and statis- 
tical machine translation (§ 4.2).

Table 2: MWE acquisition applied to lexicography




4.1   Computer-aided Lexicography

In this evaluation, I collaborated with colleagues who are 
experienced linguists and lexicographers, in order to cre- 
ate new lexical resources containing MWEs.  The lan- 
guages of the resources are English, French, Greek and 
Portuguese. Table 2 summarises the outcomes of each 
evaluation.  The created data sets are freely available.9 , 10
  We extracted English phrasal verbs (PVs) from the En- 
glish portion of the Europarl corpus11 . We considered a 
PV as being formed by a verb (except to be and to have) 
followed by a prepositional  particle12 not further than 5 
words after it13 This resulted in 5,302 phrasal verb candi- 
dates occurring  more than once in the corpus, from which
875 were automatically identified as true PVs and the oth- 
ers are currently under manual validation. Analogously, 
the French noun compounds (NCs) were extracted from 
Europarl using the following pattern: a noun followed by 
either an adjective or a prepositional  complement14 . Af- 
ter filtering out candidates that occur once in the corpus, 
we obtained 3,746 MWE candidates and part of the re- 
maining candidates will be manually analysed in the fu- 
ture.
  For Greek, in particular, considerable work has been 
done to study the linguistic properties of MWEs, but 
computational  approaches are still limited (Fotopoulou 
et al., 2008).  In our experiments,  we extracted from 
the POS-tagged Greek part of  the Europarl corpus 
words matching the following patterns: adjective-noun, 
noun-noun,  noun-determiner-noun, noun-preposition- 
noun, preposition-noun-noun,  noun-adjective-noun and 
noun-conjunction-noun.  The candidates were counted in 
two corpora and annotated with four association mea- 
sures, and the top 150 according to each measure where 
annotated by three native speakers, that is, each annotator 
judged around 1,200 candidates and in the end the anno- 
tations were joined, creating a lexicon with 815 Greek 
nominal MWEs.

12 up, off, down, back, away, in, on.
13 Even though the particle might occur further than 5 positions away,
  

Finally, the goal of the work with Portuguese com- 
plex  predicates (CPs) was  to  perform  a  qualitative 
analysis of these constructions.  Therefore, we POS- 
tagged the PLN-BR-FULL  corpus15 and extracted 
sequences of words matching the patterns:  verb- 
[determiner]-noun-preposition, verb-preposition-noun, 
verb-[preposition/determiner]-adverb  and verb-adjective. 
The extraction  process resulted in  a  list  of  407,014 
candidates which were further filtered using statistical 
association measures. Thus, an expert human annotator 
manually validated 12,545 candidates from which 699 
were annotated as   compositional verbal expressions 
and 74 as  idiomatic verbal expressions.    Afterwards, 
a  fine-grained analysis of each extraction pattern was 
conducted with the goal of finding correlations between 
syntactic flexibility   and semantic properties such as 
compositionality.

4.2   Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)

Incorporating even  simple treatments for  MWEs  in 
SMT systems can improve translation quality.  For in- 
stance, Carpuat and Diab (2010) adopt two complemen- 
tary strategies for integrating MWEs:  a static strategy 
of single-tokenisation that treats MWEs as word-with- 
spaces and a dynamic strategy that adds a count for the 
number of MWEs in the source phrase. They found that 
both strategies result in improvement of translation qual- 
ity, which suggests that SMT phrases alone do not model 
all MWE information. Morin and Daille (2010) obtained 
an improvement of 33% in the French–Japanese trans- 
lation of MWEs with a morphologically-based  composi- 
tional method for backing-off when there is not enough 
data in a dictionary to translate  a MWE (e.g. chronic fa- 
tigue syndrome  decomposed  as [chronic fatigue] [syn- 
drome], [chronic]  [fatigue syndrome] or [chronic]  [fa- 
tigue] [syndrome]).  For translating from and to mor- 
phologically rich languages like German, where a com- 
pound is in fact a single token formed through concate- 
nation, Stymne (2011) splits the compound into its sin- 
gle word components prior to translation and then applies 
some post-processing, like the reordering or merging of 
the components, after translation. She obtains improve- 
ments in BLEU from 21.63 to 22.12 in English–Swedish 
and from 19.31 to 19.73 in English–German.


such cases are sufficiently rare to be ignored in this experiment.

Table 3: Evaluation of translation of phrasal verbs in test set.


  In the current experiments,   a standard  non factored 
phrase-based  SMT  system was  built  using the open- 
source Moses toolkit with parameters similar to those of 
the baseline system for the 2011 WMT campaign. 16 . 
For training, we used the English–Portuguese Europarl 
v6 (EP) corpus, with 1.7M sentences and around 50M 
words.  The training data contains the first 200K sen- 
tences tokenized and lowercased,  resulting in 152,235 
parallel sentences and around 3.1M words. The whole 
Portuguese  corpus  was used as training data for 5-gram 
language model built with SRILM. Phrasal verbs were 
automatically identified using the jMWE tool and a dic- 
tionary of PVs. We compared the following five strate- 
gies for the integration of automatically identified phrasal 
verbs in the system:

• TOK: before translation, rearrange the verb and the 
particle in a joint configuration and transform them 
into a single token with underscore (e.g. call him up 
into call_up him).
• PV?: add a binary feature to each bi-phrase indicat- 
ing whether a source phrasal verb has been detected 
in it or not.
• PART:  replace the particle by the one most fre- 
quently used with the target verb, using a web-based 
language model with a symmetric windows of 1 to 5 
words around the particle.
• VERB:   modify the form of the Portuguese  verb 
(gerund or infinitive), according to the form detected 
on the English side.
• BILEX (or bilingual lexicon): augment the phrase ta- 
ble of the baseline system with 179,133 new bilin- 
gual phrases from an English–Portuguese phrasal 
verb lexicon.

  Table 3 shows the preliminary results of a human eval- 
uation performed on a test set of 100 sentences. The sen- 
tences were inspected and we verified that, while some 
translations improve with the integration strategies, oth- 
ers are degraded. No absolute improvement was  ob- 
served, but we believe that this is due to the fact that our 
evaluation needs to consider more fine-grained classes of

16 www.statmt.org/wmt11/baseline.html


set. Additionally, we would need to annotate more data
in order to obtain more representative results. These hy- 
potheses motivate us to continue our investigation in or- 
der to obtain a deeper understanding  the impact of each 
integration strategy on each step of the SMT system.

5   Future Experiments and Perspectives

In this paper, I described an open framework for the au- 
tomatic acquisition of MWEs from corpora. What dis- 
tinguishes it  from related work is that it  provides an 
integrated environment covering the whole acquisition 
pipeline. For each module, there are multiple available 
techniques which are flexible, portable and can be com- 
bined in several ways. The usefulness of the framework 
is then presented in terms of extrinsic application-based 
evaluation.  I presented summarised  results of ongoing 
experiments in computer-aided lexicography and in SMT. 
Although our results are promising, the experiments
on SMT need further investigation. I am currently apply-
ing syntax-based identification  and analysing word align- 
ment and translation table entries for a set of prototypi- 
cal MWEs, in order to obtain a better understanding  of 
the impact of each integration strategy on the system. 
Moreover, I would like to pursue previous experiments 
on bilingual MWE acquisition from parallel and compa- 
rable resources.  Finally, I would like to experiment on 
MWE simplification (e.g. replacing a multiword verb like 
go back by its simplex form regress) as preprocessing  for 
SMT, in order to improve translation quality by making 
the source language look more like the target language.As 
these improvements  depend in the MT paradigm, I would 
also like to evaluate strategies for the integration of verbal 
MWEs in expert MT systems.
  In spite of a large amount of work in the area, the 
treatment of MWEs in NLP applications is still an open 
and challenging problem. This is not surprising, given 
their complex and heterogeneous behaviour  (Sag et al.,
2002). At the beginning of the 2000’s, Schone and Juraf- 
sky (2001) asked whether the identification of MWEs was 
a solved problem,  and the answer that paper gave was ’no, 
it is not’. The MWE workshop series have shown that this 
is still the case, listing several challenges in MWE treat- 
ment like lexical representation and application-oriented 
evaluation.  Therefore, I believe that my thesis will be a 
significant step toward the full integration of MWE treat- 
ment in NLP applications, but there is still a long road to 
go.
