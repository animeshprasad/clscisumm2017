			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">System combination aims to find consensus translations among different machine translation systems.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">It has been proven that such consensus translations are usually better than the output of individual systems (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994).</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">In recent several years, the system combination methods based on confusion networks developed rapidly (Bangalore et al., 2001; Matusov et al., 2006; Sim et al., 2007; Rosti et al., 2007a; Rosti et al., 2007b; Rosti et al., 2008; He et al., 2008), which show state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">A confusion network consists of a sequence of sets of candidate words.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Each candidate word is associated with a score.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">The optimal consensus translation can be obtained by selecting one word from each set to maximizing the overall score.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">To construct a confusion network, one first need to choose one of the hypotheses (i.e., candidate translations) as the backbone (also called “skeleton” in the literature) and then decide the word alignments of other hypotheses to the backbone.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Hypothesis alignment plays a crucial role in confusion- network-based system combination because it has a direct effect on selecting consensus translations.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">However, a confusion network is restricted in such a way that only 1-to-1 mappings are allowed in hypothesis alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">This is not the fact even for word alignments between the same languages.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">It is more common that several words are connected to another several words.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">For example, “be capable of” and “be able to” have the same meaning.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">Although confusion-network-based approaches resort to inserting null words to alleviate this problem, they face the risk of producing degenerate translations such as “be capable to” and “be able of”.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">In this paper, we propose a new system combination method based on lattices.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">As a more general form of confusion network, a lattice is capable of describing arbitrary mappings in hypothesis alignment.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">In a lattice, each edge is associated with a sequence of words rather than a single word.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">Therefore, we select phrases instead of words in each candidate set and minimize the chance to produce unexpected translations such as “be capable to”.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">We compared our approach with the state-of-the-art confusion-network-based system (He et al., 2008) and achieved a significant absolute improvement of 1.23 BLEU points on the NIST 2005 Chinese-to-.</S>

			<S sid ="31" ssid = "2">We use an example shown in Figure 1 to illustrate our idea.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "3">Suppose that there are three hypotheses: to an appropriate numbering to reflect how to produce a translation.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "4">Each edge in a lattice is attached with a sequence of words as well as the associated probability.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "5">As lattice is a more general form of confusion network (Dyer et al., 2008), we expect that replacing confusion networks with lattices will further improve system combination.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "6">2.2 IHMM-based Alignment Method.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "7">Since the candidate hypotheses are aligned using Indirect-HMM-based (IHMM-based) alignment method (He et al., 2008) in both direction, we briefly review the IHMM-based alignment method first.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "8">Take the direction that the hypothesis is aligned to the backbone as an example.</S>

			<S sid ="39" ssid = "10">Where eI = (e1 , ..., eI ) is the backbone, e′J = Then, we perform hypothesis alignment to build a (e′1, ..., e′ J ) is a hypothesis aligned to eI , and aJ = 1 1 confusion network, as shown in Figure 1(a).</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "11">Note that although “feels like” has the same meaning with “is fond of”, a confusion network only allows for one-to-one mappings.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "12">In the confusion network shown in Figure 1(c), several null words ε are in(a1 , .., aJ ) is the alignment that specifies the posi tion of backbone word that each hypothesis word is aligned to.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "13">The translation probability p(e′ |ei ) is a linear interpolation of semantic similarity ( |e ) and serted to ensure that each hypothesis has the samesurface similarity psur (e′ |ei) and α is the interpo length.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "14">As each edge in the confusion network only has a single word, it is possible to produce inappropriate translations such as “He is like of apples”.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "15">In contrast, we allow many-to-many mappings in the hypothesis alignment shown in Figure 2(b).</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "16">For example, “like” is aligned to three words: “is”, “fond”, and “of”.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "17">Then, we use a lattice shown in Figure 1(d) to represent all possible candidate trans lation factor: p(ej |ei ) = α·psem(ej |ei )+(1−α)·psur (ej |ei ) (2) ′ ′ ′ The semantic similarity model is derived by using the source word sequence as a hidden layer, so the bilingual dictionary is necessary.</S>

			<S sid ="50" ssid = "21">The backbone is significant for it influences not only the word order, but also the following alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "22">The backbone is selected as follows:The surface similarity model is estimated by calcu EB = argmin ) T ER(E′, E) (8) lating the literal matching rate: E′∈E E∈E psur (e′ |ei ) = exp{ρ · [s(e′ , ei ) − 1]} (4) j j where s(e′j , ei ) is given by (3) Get the alignments of the backbone and hypothesis pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "23">First, each pair is aligned in both directions using the IHMM-based alignment method.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "24">s(e′ , ei ) = M (e′ , ei ) max(|e′ |, |ei |) (5) In the IHMM alignment model, bilingual dictionaries in both directions are indispensable.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "25">Then, we apply a grow-diag final algorithm which is widely where M (e′ , ei) is the length of the longest matched prefix (LMP) and ρ is a smoothing factor that specifies the mapping.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "26">The distortion probability p(aj = i|aj−1 = i′, I ) is estimated by only considering the jump distance: c(i − i′) used in bilingual phrase extraction (Koehn et al., 2003) to monolingual alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "27">The bidirectional alignments are combined to one resorting to the grow-diag-final algorithm, allowing n-to-n mappings.(4)Normalize the alignment pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "28">The word or p(i|i′, I ) = i=1 c(l − i′) (6) der of the backbone determines the word order of consensus outputs, so the word order of hypotheses The distortion parameters c(d) are grouped into 11 buckets, c(≤ −4), c(−3), ..., c(0), ..., c(5), c(≥ 6).</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "29">Since the alignments are in the same language, the distortion model favor monotonic alignments and penalize non-monotonic alignments.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "30">It is given in a intuitive way c(d) = (1 + |d − 1|)−K , d = −4, ..., 6 (7) where K is tuned on held-out data.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "31">Also the probability p0 of jumping to a null word state is tuned on held-out data.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "32">So the overall distortion model becomes p0 if i = null state must be consistent with that of the backbone.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "33">All words of a hypotheses are reordered according to the alignment to the backbone.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "34">For a word aligned to null, an actual null word may be inserted to the proper position.</S>

			<S sid ="167" ssid = "17">Confusion-network-based model In order to compare the lattice-based system with the confusion-network-based system fairly, we used IHMM-based system combination model on behalf of the confusion-network-based model described in He et al.</S>

			<S sid ="170" ssid = "20">The interpolation factor of the similarity model was set to α = 0.1.</S>
			<S sid ="171" ssid = "21">The results are shown in Table 1.</S>
			<S sid ="172" ssid = "22">IHMM stands for the IHMM-based model and Lattice stands for System MT06 MT08 BLEU% BLEU% SystemA 32.51 25.63 SystemB 31.43 26.32 SystemC 31.50 23.43 SystemD 32.41 26.28 IHMM 36.05 28.39 Lattice 36.53 29.32 Table 2: Results on the MT06 and MT08 test sets We take a real example from the output of the two systems (in Table 3) to show that higher BLEU scores correspond to better alignments and better translations.</S>
			<S sid ="173" ssid = "23">The translation of System C is selected as the backbone.</S>
			<S sid ="174" ssid = "24">From Table 3, we can see that because of 1-to-1 mappings, “Russia” is aligned to “Russian” and “’s” to “null” in the IHMM-based model, which leads to the error translation “Russian Source: SystemA: Ru ssi a m er ger of sta te ow ne d o il c om pa ny an d the sta te- run g as company in Russia SystemB: Russia ’s state-owned oil company is working with Russia ’s state-run gas company mergers SystemC: Russian state-run oil company is combined with the Russian state-run gas company SystemD: Russia ’s state-owned oil companies are combined with Russia ’s state-run gas company IHMM: Russian ’s state-owned oil company working with Russia ’s state-run gas company Lattice: Russia ’s state-owned oil company is combined with the Russian state-run gas company Table 3: A real translation example ’s”.</S>
			<S sid ="175" ssid = "25">Instead, “Russia ’s” is together aligned to ”Russian” in the lattice-based model.</S>
			<S sid ="176" ssid = "26">Also due to 1-to 1 mappings, null word aligned to “is” is inserted.</S>
			<S sid ="177" ssid = "27">As a result, “is” is missed in the output of IHMM- based model.</S>
			<S sid ="178" ssid = "28">In contrast, in the lattice-based system, “is working with” are aligned to “is combined with”, forming a phrase pair.</S>
			<S sid ="179" ssid = "29">6.2 Effect of Dictionary Scale.</S>
			<S sid ="180" ssid = "30">The dictionary is important to the semantic similarity model in IHMM-based alignment method.</S>
			<S sid ="181" ssid = "31">We evaluated the effect of the dictionary scale by using dictionaries extracted on different data sets.</S>
			<S sid ="182" ssid = "32">The dictionaries were respectively extracted on similar data sets: 30K sentence pairs, 60K sentence pairs, 289K sentence pairs (FBIS corpus) and 2500K sentence pairs.</S>
			<S sid ="183" ssid = "33">The results are illustrated in Table 4.</S>
			<S sid ="184" ssid = "34">In order to demonstrate the effect of the dictionary size clearly, the interpolation factor of similarity model was all set to α = 0.1.</S>
			<S sid ="185" ssid = "35">From Table 4, we can see that when the corpus size rise from 30k to 60k, the improvements were not obvious both on the dev set and on the test set.</S>
			<S sid ="186" ssid = "36">As the corpus was expanded to 289K, although on the dev set, the result was only 0.2 BLEU point higher, on the test set, it was 0.63 BLEU point higher.</S>
			<S sid ="187" ssid = "37">As the corpus size was up to 2500K, the BLEU scores both on the dev and test sets declined.</S>
			<S sid ="188" ssid = "38">The reason is that, on one hand, there are more noise on the 2500K sentence pairs; on the other hand, the 289K sentence pairs cover most of the words appearing on the test set.</S>
			<S sid ="189" ssid = "39">So we can conclude that in order to get better results, the dictionary scale must be up to some certain scale.</S>
			<S sid ="190" ssid = "40">If the dictionary is much smaller, the result will be impacted dramatically.</S>

			<S sid ="192" ssid = "42">For the IHMM-based alignment method, the translation probability of an English word pair is computed using a linear interpolation of the semantic similarity and the surface similarity.</S>
			<S sid ="193" ssid = "43">So the two similarity models decide the translation probability together and the proportion is controlled by the interpolation factor.</S>
			<S sid ="194" ssid = "44">We evaluated the effect of the two similarity models by varying the interpolation factor α.</S>
			<S sid ="195" ssid = "45">We used the dictionaries extracted on the FBIS data set.</S>
			<S sid ="196" ssid = "46">The result is shown in Table 5.</S>
			<S sid ="197" ssid = "47">We got the best result with α = 0.1.</S>
			<S sid ="198" ssid = "48">When we excluded the semantic similarity model (α = 0.0) or excluded the surface similarity model (α = 1.0), the performance became worse.</S>
