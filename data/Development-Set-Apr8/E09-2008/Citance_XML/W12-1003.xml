			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">In the Basque Country there exists a long- standing live performance tradition of improvising verses—a type of ex tempore composition and singing called bertsolaritza.</S>
			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Verses in bertsolaritza can be seen as discourses with strict rules governing the technical structure of them: verses must contain a certain number of lines and each line must have a defined number of syllables, certain lines have to rhyme in certain patterns, and so forth.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">In this paper we present a web-based assistant tool for constructing verses (bertsoak) according to the rules of bertsolaritza (Garzia et al, 2001).</S>

			<S sid ="9" ssid = "1">2 Relationship to earlier work.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "2">There exist some prior works dealing with Basque verse-making and computer technologies, such as BertsolariXa (Arrieta et al., 2001), which is a rhyme search tool implemented as finite-state automata using the two-level morphology formalism.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "3">The tool also contains other features, including semantic categorization of words, narrowing word-searches to certain themes, etc. While BertsolariXa focuses mostly on the word-level, the current work also includes constraints on overall verse structure in its implementation as well as a synonym search tool, a melody suggestion system, and possibilities for plugging in text-to- speech synthesis of verses.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "4">2.1 The Bertsolari tradition.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "5">Bertsolaritza is very ingrained in the Basque Country and championships, competitions and get-togethers on bertsolaritza are quite common.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "6">Usually the competitors in such event, called bertsolaris, are given a theme to produce a verse on under some very limited time constraints.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "7">But the Basque Country is not the only place that hosts such troubadour traditions—similar customs are present in many other countries such as Cuba, Brazil, Argentina, etc. The goal of the current tool is to be generalizable, and so applicable to various strategies of verse improvisation, and possibly be useful not only for Basque speakers, but also for others.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "8">Below we briefly present an example of a verse made in the Basque Country.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "9">In 1986 Andoni Egan˜ a (a well-known bertsolari) was asked to sing a bertso and assigned a topic.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "10">In the verse, he was asked to play the role of an old person who lived alone, and who realized that he could 13 Proceedings of the 6th EACL Workshop on Language Technology for Cultural Heritage, Social Sciences, and Humanities, pages 13–17, Avignon, France, 24 April 2012.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "11">Qc 2012 Association for Computational Linguistics not even tie his shoes.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "12">Within a few seconds he composed and sang three verses.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "13">Here, we analyze the first verse.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "14">Verse: Gazte aroan ibili arren gustora tirrikitarra, denbora honen joan etorriak ederki jo dit gitarra, gorputza daukat ximeldurikan ta eskuen punta zaharra, denborarekin seko galdu det gazte aroko indarra, ez al da pena gizon mardul bat hola ibili beharra.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "15">Translation: Even when I was young I was always on a spree over time I have been punished I have a crumpled body and the tip of the hands very old, Over time I lost the strength I had when I was young, It’s a shame that a strong man has to end up like me. The special charm of bertsolaritza improvisation is that people proficient in the art can quickly express a variety of ideas, although they are working with very restrictive rules concerning the number of syllables in words they use, and how the words must rhyme.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "16">We must take into account that Andoni Egan˜ a was able to sing this verse within a few seconds of being given the topic, and also, that it complies exactly with a certain metric.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "17">In this case, the verse contains eight lines, each odd line consisting of ten syllables, and each even line of eight syllables, with the even lines rhyming.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "18">Formal training in the bertsolari tradition also exists in the Basque Country.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "19">In the last 20 to 30 years, an important movement has developed that aims to provide instruction to upcoming generations on how to create verses (orally or in writing).</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "20">This kind of instruction usually takes place in learning centers called bertsoeskolak, which in English roughly means, “verse-making schools.” The proliferation of this movement has produced a strong base of young bertsolaris, of whom many achieve an outstanding level of improvisation skills.</S>

	<SECTION title="The BAD tool. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "1">BAD is the acronym for “Bertsotarako Arbel Dig- itala”, roughly “Digital verse board.” The aim of the tool is to serve as a general assistant for bertsolari-style verse composition and help verse- making learners in their learning process.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "2">This tool has been developed using the PHP programming language, but it contains certain parts developed using finite-state technology.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "3">The main functions of this tool, which will be discussed in more detail in the next five sections, are the following: visualization of the verse structure, structure checking, rhyme and synonym searching and verse singing.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "4">3.1 Verse structure.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "5">The main rules of the bertsolari verse are that a verse must consist of a certain predefined number of lines and each line in turn, of a predefined number of syllables.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "6">Traditionally, about a hundred different schemes are used, and the tool provides support for all these patterns.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "7">For example, the structure called “Hamarreko handia” has ten lines and ten syllables in the odd-numbered lines, and eight syllables in the even-numbered lines.</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "8">In this structure, the even-numbered lines have to rhyme.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "9">Selecting this scheme, the tool will mark the corresponding lines with their requirements.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "10">The web interface can be seen in figure 1, which shows the general layout of the tool, illustrated with the example verse referred to above— we see that each line has been approved in terms of line length and syllable structure by the tool.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "11">We have designed a database in which the main verse structures are saved so that when the user selects one verse schema, the system knows exactly the number of lines it must contain, where must it rhyme and how many syllables each line should have.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "12">Those schemata are also linked to melodies, each melody corresponding to one possible structure.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "13">3.2 Structure checking.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "14">After writing the verse, the system can evaluate if it is technically correct, i.e. if the overall structure is correct and if each line in the form abides by the required syllable count and rhyming scheme.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "15">The syllable counter is implemented using the foma software (Hulden, 2009), and the implementation (Hulden, 2006) can be found on the homepage of Figure 1: A verse written in the BAD web application.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "16">foma.3 Separately, we have also developed a rhyme checker, which extracts special patterns in the lines that must rhyme and checks their conformity.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "17">These patterns are extracted using foma (see section 3.4) after which some phonological rules are applied.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "18">For example, an example rule era → {era, eda, ega, eba}, models the fact that any word ending in era, for example, etxera, will rhyme with all words that end in era, eda, eba or ega.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "19">These rhyming patterns have been extracted according to the phonological laws described in (Amuriza, 1981).</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "20">3.3 Synonym search.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "21">Usually, people who write verses tend to quickly exhaust their vocabulary and ideas with to express what they want to say, or encounter problems with the number of syllables in various tentative words they have in mind.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "22">For example, if the verse-maker wants to say something containing the word “family,” (familia in Euskera, a four-syllable word) but is forced to use a three- syllable word in a particular context, the interface provides for possibilities to look for three- syllable synonyms of the word familia, producing the word sendia— a word whose meaning is otherwise the same, and made up of three syllables.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "23">For developing the synonym search, we used a modified version of the Basque Wordnet (Pociello 3 http://foma.googlecode.com et al., 2010), originally developed by the IXA group at the University of the Basque Country.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "24">Within Wordnet we search the synsets for the incoming word, and the words that correspond to those synsets are returned.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "25">3.4 Rhyme search.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "26">The classical and most well-known problem in bertsolaritza concern the rhyming patterns.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "27">As mentioned, various lines within a verse are required to rhyme, according to certain predefined schemata.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "28">To search for words that rhyme with other words in a verse, the BAD tool contains a rhyme search engine.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "29">In the interface, this is located in the right part of the BAD tool main view, as seen in figure 2.</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "30">The rhyme searcher is built upon finite-state technology, commonly used for developing morphological and phonological analyzers, and calls upon the freely available foma-tool, to calculate matching and nonmatching rhyme schemes.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "31">Its grammar is made up of regular expressions that are used to identify phonological patterns in final syllables in the input word.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "32">The result of the search is the intersection of these patterns and all the words generated from a morphological description of Basque (Alegria et al., 1996)—that is, a list of all words that match both the required phonological constraints given (rhyming) and a morphological description of Basque.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "33">Based upon figure 2, if we search rhymes for the word landa (cottage), the system proposes a Figure 2: The response of the rhyme search engine.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "34">set of words that can be filtered depending on the number of syllables required.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "35">Among this list of words, we can find some words that end in anda, such as, Irlanda (Ireland) or eztanda (explosion), but through the application of phonological equivalency rules we also find terms like ganga (vault).</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "36">3.5 Singing synthesis.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "37">Another characteristic, as mentioned, is that, in the end, the verses are intended to be sung instead of only being textually represented.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "38">Based on other ongoing work in singing synthesis, we have designed a system for singing the verses entered into the system in Basque.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "39">This is based on the “singing mode” of the Festival text-to-speech system (Taylor et al., 1998).</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "40">The advantage of using this is that Festival is open-source and has given us ample opportunities to modify its behavior.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "41">However, as Festival does not currently support Basque directly, we have relied on the Spanish support of the Festival system.4 4 While morphologically and syntactically, Spanish and Basque have no relationship whatsoever, phonetically the languages are quite close, with only a few phonemes, syl Based on current work by the Aholab research team in Bilbao—a lab that works on Basque speech synthesis and recognition—we have implemented a singing module for BAD, based on the text-to-speech HTS engine (Erro et al., 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "42">Our application is able to sing the composed verses entered into the system in Basque, with a choice of various standard melodies for bertsolaritza.5</S>

			<S sid ="71" ssid = "1">Now that the BAD tool has been developed, our intention is to evaluate it.</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "2">To make a qualitative evaluation we have gotten in touch with some verse-making schools (bertsoeskola), so that they can test the system and send us their feedback using a form.</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "3">Once the evaluation is made, we will improve it according to the feedback and the system will be made public.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "4">Our ultimate goal is to develop a system able to create verses automatically.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "5">To achieve this long- term goal, there is plenty of work to do and basic research to be done.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "6">We have in our hands a good corpus of 3,500 Basque verse transcriptions, so we intend to study these verses from a morphological, syntactical, semantical and pragmatic point of view.</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "7">In the short term, we also plan to expand the synonym search to be able to provide searches for semantically related words and subjects (and not just synonyms), like hypernyms or hyponyms.</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "8">The Basque WordNet provides a good opportunity for this, as one is easily able to traverse the WordNet to encounter words with varying degrees of semantic similarity.</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "9">Another feature that we want to develop is a system that receives as input a verse together with a MIDI file, and where the system automatically sings the verse to the music provided.</S>
			<S sid ="80" ssid = "10">Finally, in order for the system to be able to provide better proposals for the verse artist—including perhaps humorous and creative proposals—we intend to work with approaches to computational creativity.</S>
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "11">We are considering different approaches to this topic, such as in the work on Hahacronym (Stock et al., 2005) or the Standup riddle builder (Ritchie et al., 2001).</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "12">labification rules, and stress rules being different enough to disturb the system’s behavior.</S>
