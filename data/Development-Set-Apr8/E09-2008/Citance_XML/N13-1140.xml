			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Despite morphological phenomena’s salience in most human languages, many NLP systems treat fully inflected forms as the atomic units of language.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">By assuming independence of lexical stems’ various surface forms, this avoidance approach exacerbates the problem of data sparseness.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">If it is employed at all, morphological analysis of text tends to be treated as a preprocessing step to other NLP modules.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">While this latter disambiguation approach helps address data sparsity concerns, it has substantial drawbacks: it requires supervised learning from expert-annotated corpora, and determining the optimal morphological granularity is labor-intensive (Habash and Sadat, 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Neither approach fully exploits the finite-state transducer (FST) technology that has been so successful for modeling the mapping between surface forms and their morphological analyses (Karttunen and Beesley, 2005), and the mature collections of high quality transducers that already exist for many languages (e.g., Turkish, Russian, Arabic).</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">Much linguistic knowledge is encoded in such FSTs.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">In this paper, we develop morphology-aware non- parametric Bayesian language models that bring together handwritten FSTs with statistical modeling and require no token-level annotation.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">The sparsity issue discussed above is addressed by hierarchical priors that share statistical strength across different inflections of the same stem by backing off to word formation models that piece together morphemes using FSTs.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Furthermore, because of the nonparametric formulation of our models, the regular morphological patterns found in the long tail of word types will rely more heavily on deeper analysis, while frequent and idiosyncratically behaved forms are modeled opaquely.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Our prior can be used in virtually any generative model of language as a replacement for multinomial distributions over words, bringing morphological awareness to numerous applications.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">For various morphologically rich languages, we show that:• our model can provide rudimentary unsuper vised disambiguation for a highly ambiguous analyzer; • integrating morphology into n-gram language models allows better generalization to unseen words and can improve the performance of applications that are truly open vocabulary; and • bilingual word alignment models also benefit greatly from sharing translation information 1206 Proceedings of NAACLHLT 2013, pages 1206–1215, Atlanta, Georgia, 9–14 June 2013.</S>

			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">We are particularly interested in low-resource scenarios, where one has to make the most of the small quantity of available data, and overcoming data sparseness is crucial.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">If analyzers exist in such settings, they tend to be highly ambiguous, and annotated data for learning to disambiguate are also likely to be scarce or nonexistent.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">Therefore, in our experiments with Russian, we compare two analyzers: a rapidly-developed guesser, which models regular inflectional paradigms but contains no lexicon or irregular forms, and a high-quality analyzer.</S>

	<SECTION title="Word Models with Morphology. " number = "2">
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "1">In this section, we describe a generative model of word formation based on PitmanYor processes that generates word types using a finite-state morphological generator.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "2">At a high level, the process first produces lexicons of stems and inflectional patterns; then it generates a lexicon of inflected forms using the finite-state generator.</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "3">Finally, the inflected forms are used to generate observed data.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "4">Different independence assumptions can be made at each of these levels to encode beliefs about where stems, inflections, and surface forms should share statistical strength.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "5">2.1 PitmanYor Processes.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "6">2.2 Unigram Morphology Model.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "7">The most basic expression of our model is a uni- gram model of text.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "8">So far, we only assume that each word can be analyzed into a stem and a sequence of morphemes forming an inflection pattern.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "9">Let Gs be a distribution over stems, Gp be a distribution over inflectional patterns, and let GENERATE be a deterministic mapping from (stem, pattern) pairs to inflected word forms.1 An inflected word type is generated with the following process, which we designate MP(Gs, Gd, GENERATE): stem ∼ Gs pattern ∼ Gp word = GENERATE(stem, pattern) For example, in Russian, we might sample stem = прочий,2 pattern = STEM+Adj+Pl+Dat, and obtain word = прочим.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "10">This model could be used directly to generate observed tokens.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "11">However, we have said nothing about Gs and Gp, and the assumption that stems and patterns are independent is clearly unsatisfying.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "12">We therefore assume that both the stem and the pattern distributions are generated from PY processes, and that MP(Gs, Gp, GENERATE) is itself the base distribution of a PYP.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "13">Our work relies extensively on PitmanYor processes, which provide a flexible framework for expressing backoff and interpolation relationships and extending standard models with richer word distributions (Pitman and Yor, 1997).</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "14">They have been shown to match the performance of state-of-the-art language models and to give estimates that follow appropriate power laws (Teh, 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "15">A draw from a PitmanYor process (PYP), denoted G ∼ PY(d, θ, G0), is a discrete distribution over a (possibly infinite) set of events, which we denote abstractly E . The process is parameterized by a discount parameter 0 ≤ d &lt; 1, a strength parameter θ &gt; −d, and a base distribution G0 over the event space E . In this work, our focus is on the base distribution G0.</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "16">We place vague priors on the hyperparametersd ∼ U([0, 1]) and (θ + d) ∼ Gamma(1, 1).</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "17">Infer ence in PYPs is discussed below.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "18">Gs ∼ PY(ds, θs, G0) Gp ∼ PY(dp, θp, G0) Gw ∼ PY(d, θ, MP(Gs, Gp, GENERATE)) A draw Gw from this PYP is a unigram distribution over tokens.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "19">2.3 Base Stem Model G0.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "20">In general there are an unbounded number of stems possible in any language, so we set G0 to be character trigram model, which we statically estimate, with KneserNey smoothing, from a large corpus of word types in the language being modeled.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "21">While using fixed parameters estimated to maximize likelihood is 1 The assumption of determinism is only inappropriate in cases of inflectional spelling variants (e.g., modeled vs. modelled) or pronunciation variants (e.g., reduced forms in certain environments).</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "22">2 прочий (pronounced [pr5tCij]) = other questionable from the perspective of Bayesian learning, it is tremendously beneficial for computational reasons.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "23">For some applications (e.g., word align available to compute the marginal base word distribution: ment), the set of possible stems for a corpus S can be precomputed, so we will also experiment with using a uniform stem distribution based on this set.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "24">p(w | G0 ) = GENERATE(s,p)=w p(s | Gs) p(p | Gp) 2.4 Base Pattern Model G0.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "25">Several choices are possible for the base pattern distribution: MP0 We can assume a uniform G0 when the number of patterns is small.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "26">MP1 To be able to generalize to new patterns, we can draw the length of the pattern from a Poisson distribution and generate morphemes one by one from a uniform distribution.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "27">MP2 A more informative prior is a Markov chain of morphemes, where each morpheme is generated conditional on the preceding morpheme.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "28">The choice of the base pattern distribution could depend on the complexity of the inflectional patterns produced by the morphological analyzer, reflecting the type of morphological phenomena present in a given language.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "29">For example, the number of possible patterns can practically be considered finite in Russian, but this assumption is not valid for languages with more extensive derivational morphology like Turkish.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "30">2.5 Posterior Inference.</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "31">For most applications, rather than directly generating from a model using the processes outlined above, we seek to infer posterior distributions over latent parameters and structures, given a sample of data.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "32">Although there is no known analytic form of the PYP density, it is possible to marginalize the draws from it and to work directly with observations.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "33">This marginalization produces the classical Chinese restaurant process representation (Teh, Since our approach encodes morphology using FSTs, which are invertible, this poses no problem.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "34">To illustrate, consider the Russian word прочим, which may be analyzed in several ways: прочий +Adj +Sg +Neut +Instr прочий +Adj +Sg +Masc +Instr прочий +Adj +Pl +Dat прочить +Verb +Pl +1P прочее +Pro +Sg +Ins Because the set of possible analyses is in general small, marginalization is fast and complex blocked sampling is not necessary.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "35">Finally, to infer hyperparameter values (d, θ, . . .), a Metropolis-Hastings update is interleaved with Gibbs sampling steps for the rest of the hidden variables.3 Having described a model for generating words, we now show its usage in several contexts.</S>

			<S sid ="56" ssid = "2">The corpus is assumed to be generated from the unigram distribution Gw , and the base stem model is set to a fixed character tri- gram model.4 After learning the parameters of the model, we can find for each word in the vocabulary its most likely analysis and use this as a crude disambiguation step.</S>

			<S sid ="61" ssid = "2">3.1 Morphological Guessers.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "3">Finite-state morphological analyzers are usually specified in three parts: a stem lexicon, which defines the words in the language and classifies them into several categories according to their grammatical function and their morphological properties; a set of prefixes and suffixes that can be applied to each category to form surface words; and possibly alternation rules that can encode exceptions and spelling variations.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "4">The combination of these parts provides a powerful framework for defining a generative model of words.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "5">Such models can be reversed to obtain an analyzer.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "6">However, while the two latter parts can be relatively easy to specify, enumerating a comprehensive stem lexicon is a time consuming and necessarily incomplete process, as some categories are truly open-class.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "7">To allow unknown words to be analyzed, one can use a guesser that attempts to analyze words missing in the lexicon.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "8">Can we eliminate the stem lexicon completely and use only the guesser?</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "9">This is what we try to do by designing a lexicon-free analyzer for Russian.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "10">A guesser was developed in three hours; it is prone to over-generation and produces ambiguous analyses for most words but covers a large number of morphological phenomena (gender, case, tense, etc.).</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "11">For example, the word иврите5 can be correctly analyzed as иврит+Noun+Masc+Prep+Sg but also as the incorrect forms: иврить+Verb+Pres+2P+Pl, иврита+Noun+Fem+Dat+Sg, иври- тя+Noun+Fem+Prep+Sg, and more.</S>

			<S sid ="72" ssid = "13">We train the unigram model on a 1.7M-word corpus of TED talks transcriptions translated into Russian (Cettolo et al., 2012) and evaluate our analyzer against a test set consisting of 1,500 gold- standard analyses obtained from the morphology disambiguation task of the DIALOG 2010 conference (Lyaševskaya et al., 2010).6 Each analysis is composed of a lemma (иврит), a part of speech (Noun), and a sequence of additional functional morphemes (Masc,Prep,Sg).</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "14">We consider only open-class categories: nouns, ad 5 иврите = Hebrew (masculine noun, prepositional case) 6 http://rueval.ru jectives, adverbs and verbs, and evaluate the output of our model with three metrics: the lemma accuracy, the part-of-speech accuracy, and the morphology F -measure.7 As a baseline, we consider picking a random analysis from output of the analyzer or choosing the most frequent lemma and the most frequent morphological pattern.8 Then, we use our model with each of the three versions of the pattern model described in §2.2.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "15">Finally, as an upper bound, we use the gold standard to select one of the analyses produced by the guesser.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "16">Since our evaluation is not directly comparable to the standard for this task, we use for reference a high-quality analyzer from Xerox9 disambiguated with the MP0 model (all of the models have very close accuracy in this case).</S>

			<S sid ="158" ssid = "1">Computational morphology has received considerable attention in NLP since the early work on two- level morphology (Koskenniemi, 1984; Kaplan and 11 ödevinin, ödevini, ödevleri; bitmez, bitirileceg˘ inden, bitmesiyle, ...</S>
			<S sid ="159" ssid = "2">Kay, 1994).</S>
			<S sid ="160" ssid = "3">It is now widely accepted that finite- state transducers have sufficient power to express nearly all morphological phenomena, and the XFST toolkit (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) has contributed to the practical adoption of this modeling approach.</S>
			<S sid ="161" ssid = "4">Recently, open-source tools have been released: in this paper, we used Foma (Hulden, 2009) to develop the Russian guesser.</S>
			<S sid ="162" ssid = "5">Since some inflected forms have several possible analyses, there has been a great deal of work on selecting the intended one in context (Hakkani-Tür et al., 2000; Hajicˇ et al., 2001; Habash and Rambow, 2005; Smith et al., 2005; Habash et al., 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="163" ssid = "6">Our disambiguation model is closely related to generative models used for this purpose (Hakkani-Tür et al., 2000).</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "7">Rule-based analysis is not the only approach to modeling morphology, and many unsupervised models have been proposed.12 Heuristic segmentation approaches based on the minimum description length principle (Goldsmith, 2001; Creutz and La- gus, 2007; de Marcken, 1996; Brent et al., 1995) have been shown to be effective, and Bayesian model-based versions have been proposed as well (Goldwater et al., 2011; Snyder and Barzilay, 2008; Snover and Brent, 2001).</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "8">In §3, we suggested a third way between rule-based approaches and fully unsupervised learning that combines the best of both worlds.</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "9">Morphological analysis or segmentation is crucial to the performance of several applications: machine translation (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005; AlHaj and Lavie, 2010; Oflazer and ElKahlout, 2007; Minkov et al., 2007; Habash and Sadat, 2006, inter alia), automatic speech recognition (Creutz et al., 2007), and syntactic parsing (Tsarfaty et al., 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="167" ssid = "10">Several methods have been proposed to integrate morphology into n-gram language models, including factored language models (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003), discriminative language modeling (Arı- soy et al., 2008), and more heuristic approaches (Monz, 2011).</S>
			<S sid ="168" ssid = "11">Despite the fundamentally open nature of the lexicon (Heaps, 1978), there has been distressingly lit 12 Developing a high-coverage analyzer can be a time- consuming process even with the simplicity of modern toolkits, and unsupervised morphology learning is an attractive problem for computational cognitive science.</S>
			<S sid ="169" ssid = "12">tle attention to the general problem of open vocabulary language modeling problem (most applications make a closed-vocabulary assumption).</S>
			<S sid ="170" ssid = "13">The classic exploration of open vocabulary language modeling is Brown et al.</S>
			<S sid ="171" ssid = "14">(1992), which proposed the strategy of interpolating between word- and character-based models.</S>
			<S sid ="172" ssid = "15">Character-based language models are reviewed by Carpenter (2005).</S>
			<S sid ="173" ssid = "16">So-called hybrid models that model both words and sublexical units have become popular in speech recognition (Shaik et al., 2012; Parada et al., 2011; Bazzi, 2002).</S>
			<S sid ="174" ssid = "17">Open- vocabulary language language modeling has also recently been explored in the context of assistive technologies (Roark, 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="175" ssid = "18">Finally, PitmanYor processes (PYPs) have become widespread in natural language processing since they are natural power-law generators.</S>
			<S sid ="176" ssid = "19">It has been shown that the widely used modified KneserNey estimator (Chen and Goodman, 1998) for n- gram language models is an approximation of the posterior predictive distribution of a language model with hierarchical PYP priors (Goldwater et al., 2011; Teh, 2006).</S>

	<SECTION title="Conclusion. " number = "7">
			<S sid ="177" ssid = "1">We described a generative model which makes use of morphological analyzers to produce richer word distributions through sharing of statistical strength between stems.</S>
			<S sid ="178" ssid = "2">We have shown how it can be integrated into several models central to NLP applications and have empirically validated the effectiveness of these changes.</S>
			<S sid ="179" ssid = "3">Although this paper mostly focused on languages that are well studied and for which high-quality analyzers are available, our models are especially relevant in low-resource scenarios because they do not require disambiguated analyses.</S>
			<S sid ="180" ssid = "4">In future work, we plan to apply these techniques to languages such as Kinyarwanda, a resource-poor but morphologically rich language spoken in Rwanda.</S>
			<S sid ="181" ssid = "5">It is our belief that knowledge-rich models can help bridge the gap between low- and high-resource languages.</S>
