<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">Foma is largely compatible with the Xerox/PARC finite-state toolkit.</S>
<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Foma is a finite-state compiler, programming language, and regular expression/finite-state library designed for multipurpose use with explicit support for automata theoretic research, constructing lexical analyzers for programming languages, and building morphological/phonological analyzers, as well as spellchecking applications.</S>
<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">The compiler allows users to specify finite-state automata and transducers incrementally in a similar fashion to AT&amp;Tâ€™s fsm (Mohri et al., 1997) and Lextools (Sproat, 2003), the Xerox/PARC finite- state toolkit (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) and the SFST toolkit (Schmid, 2005).</S>
<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Foma is licensed under the GNU general public license: in keeping with traditions of free software, the distribution that includes the source code comes with a user manual and a library of examples.</S>
<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">This makes it straightforward to build spell-checkers from morphological transducers by simply extracting the range of the transduction and matching words approximately.</S>
<S sid ="48" ssid = "1">Though the main concern with Foma has not been that of efficiency, but of compatibility and extendibility, from a usefulness perspective it is important to avoid bottlenecks in the underlying algorithms that can cause compilation times to skyrocket, especially when constructing and combining large lexical transducers.</S>
