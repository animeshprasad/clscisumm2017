This paper offers a broad insight into of Arabic constituency parsing by analyzing the interplay of linguistic phenomena, annotation choices, and model design. It is probably the first analysis of Arabic parsing of this kind. It is well-known that English constituency parsing models do not generalize to other languages and treebanks. Explanations for this phenomenon are relative informativeness of lexicalization, insensitivity to morphology and the effect of variable word order and these factors lead to syntactic disambiguation. The authors use linguistic and annotation insights to develop a manually annotated grammar and evaluate it and finally provide a realistic evaluation in which segmentation is performed in a pipeline jointly with parsing. The authors show that PATB is similar to other tree-banks but that annotation consistency remains low.
