			<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">Computer scientists and linguists now largely agree that representing discourse structure as a hierarchical relational structure over discourse units linked by discourse relations is appropriate to account for a variety of interpretative tasks.</S>
			<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">There is also some agreement over the taxonomy of discourse relations —almost all current theories include expressions that refer to relations like Elaboration, Explanation, Result, Narration, Contrast, Attribution.</S>
			<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">Sanders, Spooren, and Noord- man 1992; Bateman and Rondhuis 1997 discuss correspondences between different taxonomies.</S>
			<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">Different theories, however, assume different sets of constraints that govern these representations; some advocate trees: RST Mann and Thompson 1987, DLTAG Webber et al. 1999; others, graphs of different sorts: SDRT Asher and Lascarides 2003, Graphbank Wolf and Gibson 2005.</S>

But how exactly do these annotations compare?</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">In the illustrative example chosen and for the relation types they agree on (Elaboration and Attribution), different annotation models and theoretical frameworks invoke different numbers of instances of these relations and assign the instances different arguments or different scopes, at least on the surface.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">In this paper we develop a method of comparing the scopes of relations in different types of structures by developing a notion of interpretation shared between different structures.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">This interpretation specifies the set of possible scopes of relations compatible with a given structure.</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">This theoretical work is important for furthering empirical research on discourse.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Discourse annotations are expensive.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">It behooves researchers to use as much data as they can, annotated in several formalisms, while pursuing prediction or evaluation in their chosen theory.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">This paper provides a theoretical basis to do this.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">What a given structure expresses exactly is often not clear; some discourse theories are not completely formalized or lack a worked out semantics.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Nevertheless, in all of them rhetorical relations have semantic consequences bearing on tasks like text summarization, textual entailment, anaphora resolution, as well as the temporal, spatial and thematic organization of a text Hobbs, Stickel, and Martin 1993; Kehler 2002; Asher 1993; Lascarides and Asher 1993; Hobbs, Stickel, and Martin 1993; Hitzeman, Moens, and Grover 1995, inter alia.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">Theories like SDRT or Polanyi et al. 2004 adopt a conception of discourse structure as logical form.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">Discourse structures are like logical formulae and relations 1 The Penn Discourse Treebank Prasad et al. 2008 could also be considered as a corpus with partial dependency structures.</S>

			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">Qc 2013 Association for Computational Linguistics function like logical operators on the meaning of their arguments.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">Hence their exact scope has great semantic impact on the phenomena we have mentioned, in exactly the way the relative scope of quantifiers make a great semantic difference in first order logic.</S>
			<S sid ="21" ssid = "21">By concentrating on exact meaning representations, however, the syntax-semantics interface becomes quite complex: as happens with quantifiers at the intra sentential level, discourse relations might semantically require a scope that is, at least a priori, not determined by syntactic considerations alone and violates surface order (see s2 ).</S>
			<S sid ="22" ssid = "22">Other theories like Polanyi’s Linguistic Discourse Model (LDM) of Polanyi 1985; Polanyi and Scha 1984, and DLTAG Webber et al. 1999 explicitly adopt a syntactic point of view, and RST with strongly constrained (tree-shaped) structures is subject to parsing approaches duVerle and Prendinger 2009; Sagae 2009; Subba and Di Eugenio 2009 that adhere to the syntactic approach in adopting decoding strategies of syntactic parsing.</S>
			<S sid ="23" ssid = "23">In such theories, discourse structure representations, subject to syntactic constraints (e.g. dominance of spans of text one over another) respect surface order but do not always and unproblematically yield a semantic interpretation that fits intuitions.</S>
			<S sid ="24" ssid = "24">According to Marcu 1996, an RST tree is not by itself sufficient to generate desired predictions; he employs the nuclearity principle, NP, as an additional interpretation principle on scopes of relations.</S>
			<S sid ="25" ssid = "25">We focus on two theories: RST, which offers the model for the annotations of the RST treebank Carlson, Marcu, and Okurowski 2002 and the Potsdam commentary corpus Stede 2004, and on SDRT, which counts several small corpora annotated with semantic scopes, Discor Baldridge, Asher, and Hunter 2007 and Annodis Afantenos et al. 2012.</S>
			<S sid ="26" ssid = "26">We describe these theories in section 2.</S>
			<S sid ="27" ssid = "27">We will also compare these two theories to dependency tree representations of discourse Muller et al. 2012.</S>
			<S sid ="28" ssid = "28">Section 3 introduces a language for describing semantics scopes of relations that is powerful enough to: i) compare the expressiveness (in terms of what different scopes can be expressed) of the different formalisms considered; ii) give a formal target language that will provide comparable interpretations of the different structures at stake.</S>
			<S sid ="29" ssid = "29">Section 4 discusses Marcu’s nuclearity principle and proposes an alternative way to interpret an RST tree as a set of different possible scopes expressed in our language.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "30">Section 5 provides intertranslability results between the different formalisms.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "31">Section 6 defines a measure of similarity over discourse structures in different formalisms.</S>

			<S sid ="32" ssid = "1">These formalisms we introduce here all require the input text to be segmented into elementary units (EDUs).</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "2">The definition of what an EDU is varies slightly with the formalism, but roughly corresponds to the clause level in RST, SDRT and other theories.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "3">We assume a segmentation common to the different formalisms and use examples with a non controversial and intuitive segmentation.</S>

			<S sid ="63" ssid = "1">We provide here a language expressive and general enough to express the structures of the 3 theories.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "2">All our case-study theories involve structures described by a list of rhetorical relations and their arguments.</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "3">Two things may vary: first, the nature of the arguments.</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "4">SDRT for instance, introduces complex constituents ( π : Rsubord (b, c) less, such RST structures are expressible in our framework, if we assume certain semantic equivalences.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "5">RST allows for two cases of non-binary trees: (i) nucleus with n satellites, each one linked to the nucleus by some relation Rn . Such a structure is semantically equivalent to the conjunction of n-binary relations Rn between the nucleus and the nth satellite, which is expressible in our framework.</S>
			<S sid ="68" ssid = "6">(ii) RST also allows for nary multinuclear relations such as List and Sequence.</S>
			<S sid ="69" ssid = "7">In our understanding, multinuclear relations R(a1 , . . .</S>
			<S sid ="70" ssid = "8">an ), essentially serve a purpose of expressiveness, and such an nary tree is an equivalent to the split non-tree shaped structure R(a1 , a2 ) ∧ R(a2 , a3 ) . . .</S>
			<S sid ="71" ssid = "9">R(a(n−1) , an ).</S>
			<S sid ="72" ssid = "10">This seems clear for the Sequence relation, which states that a1 . . .</S>
			<S sid ="73" ssid = "11">an are in temporal sequence and can be equivalently formulated as “each ai precedes ai+1 ”.</S>
			<S sid ="74" ssid = "12">This might appear less obvious for the List relation.</S>
			<S sid ="75" ssid = "13">The semantics (as it appears on the RST website http: //www.sfu.ca/rst/) of this relation requires the ai to be ”comparable”, and as far as this is a transitive property, we can split the relation into a set of binary ones.</S>
			<S sid ="76" ssid = "14">Formally, our scope language Lsco pes is a fragment of that of monadic second order logic with two sorts of individuals: relation instances (i), and elementary consti tuants (l).</S>
			<S sid ="77" ssid = "15">Below, we assume R is the set of all relation names (elaboration, narration, justification, . . .</S>
			<S sid ="78" ssid = "16">Definition 1 (Scoping language).</S>
			<S sid ="79" ssid = "17">Let S be the set {i, l}.</S>

			<S sid ="85" ssid = "23">The set of predicate symbols is as follows: as arguments of relations (e.g. Rsubord (a, π) ), 1) For each relation symbol r in R, LR is a unary which finds a counterpart within RS Trees, where a relation may directly appear as argument of another (R(aN , R(bN , cS )S )) but not within dependency trees.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "24">Second, the set of constraints that restrict the possible lists of such relations can vary across theories (e.g. right frontier, or requirement for a tree structure).</S>
			<S sid ="87" ssid = "25">To deal with the first point above, we remark that it suffices to list, for each instance of a discourse relation, the set of elementary constituents that belong to its left and right scope in order to express the three kinds of structures.</S>
			<S sid ="88" ssid = "26">We do this in a way that an isomorphic structure can always be recovered.</S>

For each relation symbol R such as justification or elaboration, the predicate LR takes a relation instance r has argument and states that r is an instance of the rhetorical relation R. Predicates sub, coord and sub−1 apply to a re lation instance r, respectively specifying that r’s left argument hierarchically dominate its right argument, that both are of equal hierarchical importance, or that the left one is subordinate to the right one.</S>
