			<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">Discriminative model (Och and Ney, 2002) can easily incorporate non-independent and overlapping features, and has been dominating the research field of statistical machine translation (SMT) in the last decade.</S>
			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">Recent work have shown that SMT benefits a lot from exploiting large amount of features (Liang et al., 2006; Tillmann and Zhang, 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007; Blunsom et al., 2008; Chiang et al., 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">However, the training of the large number of features was always restricted in fairly small data sets.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">Some systems limit the number of training examples, while others use short sentences to maintain efficiency.</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Overfitting problem often comes when training many features on a small data (Watanabe et al., 880 2007; Chiang et al., 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">Obviously, using much more data can alleviate such problem.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">Furthermore, large data also enables us to globally train millions of sparse lexical features which offer accurate clues for SMT.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Despite these advantages, to the best of our knowledge, no previous discriminative training paradigms scale up to use a large amount of training data.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">The main obstacle comes from the complexity of packed forests or n-best lists generation which requires to search through all possible translations of each training example, which is computationally prohibitive in practice for SMT.</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">To make normalization efficient, contrastive estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Poon et al., 2009) introduce neighborhood for unsupervised log-linear model, and has presented positive results in various tasks.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Motivated by these work, we use a translation forest (Section 3) which contains both “reference” derivations that potentially yield the reference translation and also neighboring “non-reference” derivations that fail to produce the reference translation.1However, the complexity of generating this translation forest is up to O(n6), because we still need bi parsing to create the reference derivations.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">Consequently, we propose a method to fast generate a subset of the forest.</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">The key idea (Section 4) is to initialize a reference derivation tree with maximum score by the help of word alignment, and then traverse the tree to generate the subset forest in linear time.</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">Besides the efficiency improvement, such a forest allows us to train the model without resort 1 Exactly, there are no reference derivations, since derivation is a latent variable in SMT.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">We call them reference derivation just for convenience.</S>

Generally, this is done by deleting a node X0,1 . ing to constructing the oracle reference (Liang et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2009), which is nontrivial for SMT and needs to be determined experimentally.</S>

			<S sid ="42" ssid = "1">We use a translation forest that contains both “reference” derivations that potentially yield the reference translation and also some neighboring “non- reference” derivations that fail to produce the reference translation.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "2">Therefore, our forest only represents some of the derivations for a sentence given an SCFG rule table.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "3">The motivation of using such a forest is efficiency.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "4">However, since this space contains both “good” and “bad” translations, it still provides evidences for discriminative training.</S>
			<S sid ="46" ssid = "5">First see the example in Figure 1.</S>
			<S sid ="47" ssid = "6">The derivation tree t1 represented by solid hyperedges is a reference derivation.</S>

			<S sid ="50" ssid = "9">Considering the rules in each derivation, the difference between t1 and t2 lies in r3 and r4.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "10">Although r3 has a same source side with r4, it produces a different translation.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "11">While r3 provides a swapping translation, r4 generates a monotone translation.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "12">Thus, the derivation t2 fails to move the subject “police” to the behind of verb “shot dead”, resulting a wrong translation “the gunman was police shot dead”.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "13">Given such derivations, we hope that the discriminative model is capable to explain why should use a reordering rule in this context.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "14">Generally, our forest contains all the reference derivations RT for a sentence given a rule table, and some neighboring non-reference derivations N T , which can be defined from RT .

			<S sid ="56" ssid = "15">We use C (e) to represent the set of competing hyperedges of e. Two derivations t1 = ⟨V 1, E1⟩ and t2 = ⟨V 2, E2⟩ are competing derivations if there exists e1 ∈ E1 and e2 ∈ E2: 2 V 1 = V 2 ∧ E1 − e1 = E2 − e2 ∧ e2 ∈ C (e1) (2) In other words, derivations t1 and t2 only differ in e1 and e2, and these two hyperedges are competing hyperedges.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "16">We use C (t) to represent the set of competing derivations of tree t, and C (t,e) to represent the set of competing derivations of t if the competition occurs in hyperedge e in t. Given a rule table, the set of reference derivations RT for a sentence is determined.</S>

			<S sid ="103" ssid = "43">Since rule table is fixed, the second step is a process of decoding.</S>

			<S sid ="105" ssid = "45">In such case, we keep the origin derivation unchanged.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "46">The changes made by the two operators are local.</S>
			<S sid ="107" ssid = "47">Considering the change of rules, the lexicalize operator deletes two rules and adds one new rule, while the generalize operator deletes one rule and adds two new rules.</S>
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "48">Such local changes provide us with a way to incrementally calculate the scores of new derivations.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "49">We use this method motivated by Gibbs Sampler (Blunsom et al., 2009) which has been used for efficiently learning rules.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "50">The different lies in that we use the operator for decoding where the rule table is fixing.</S>

			<S sid ="112" ssid = "52">The generation starts from an initial reference derivation with max score.</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "53">This requires bi-parsing (Dyer, 2010) over the source sentence f and the reference translation e. In practice, we may face three problems.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "54">First is efficiency problem.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "55">Exhaustive search over the space under SCFG requires O(|f |3|e|3).</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "56">To parse quickly, we only visit the tight consistent (Zhang et al., 2008) bi-spans with the help of word alignment a. Only visiting tight consistent spans greatly speeds up bi-parsing.</S>

			<S sid ="118" ssid = "58">Second is degenerate problem.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "59">If we only use the features as traditional SCFG systems, the bi- parsing may end with a derivation consists of some giant rules or rules with rare source/target sides, which is called degenerate solution (DeNero et al., 2006).</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "60">That is because the translation rules with rare source/target sides always receive a very high translation probability.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "61">We add a prior score log(#rule) for each rule, where #rule is the number of occurrence of a rule, to reward frequent reusable rules and derivations with more rules.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "62">Finally, we may fail to create reference derivations due to the limitation in rule extraction.</S>

			<S sid ="169" ssid = "21">The use of large data promises us to use full vocabulary of training data for the context word features, which results millions of fully lexicalized context features.</S>
			<S sid ="170" ssid = "22">During decoding, when a context feature does not exit, we simply ignore it.</S>
			<S sid ="171" ssid = "23">The weights of 8 traditional features are fixed the same as MERT also.</S>
			<S sid ="172" ssid = "24">We fix these weights because the translation feature weights fluctuate intensely during online learning.</S>
			<S sid ="173" ssid = "25">The main reason may come from the degeneration solution mentioned in Section 4.2, where rare rules with very high translation probability are selected as the reference derivations.</S>
			<S sid ="174" ssid = "26">Another reason could be the fact that translation features are dense intensify the fluctuation.</S>

			<S sid ="190" ssid = "42">Our algorithm runs on the entire training data, which requires to load all the rules into the memory.</S>
			<S sid ="191" ssid = "43">To fit within memory, we cut off those composed rules which only happen once in the training data.</S>
			<S sid ="192" ssid = "44">Here a composed rule is a rule that can be produced by any other extracted rules.</S>
			<S sid ="193" ssid = "45">A 4-grams language model is trained by the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).</S>

			<S sid ="196" ssid = "48">Since the rule table of the entire data is too large to be loaded to the memory (even drop one-count rules), we remove many sentence pairs to create a much smaller data yet having a comparable performance with the entire data.</S>
			<S sid ="197" ssid = "49">The intuition lies in that if most of the source words of a sentence need to be translated by the added rules, then the word alignment may be highly crossed and the sentence may be useless.</S>
			<S sid ="198" ssid = "50">We create minimum rules from a sentence pair, and count the number of source words in those minimum rules that are added rules.</S>
			<S sid ="199" ssid = "51">For example, suppose the result minimum rules of a sentence contain r3 which is an added rule, then we count 1 time for the sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="200" ssid = "52">If the number of such source word is more than 10% of the total number, we will drop the sentence pair.</S>
			<S sid ="201" ssid = "53">We compare the performances of MERT setting on three bilingual data: the entire data that contains 42.3M Chinese and 48.2M English words; 519K data that contains 8.6M Chinese and 10.6M English words; FBIS (LDC2003E14) parts that contains 6.9M Chinese and 9.1M English words.</S>

			<S sid ="206" ssid = "58">The training of MERT and perceptron run on MT02.</S>
			<S sid ="207" ssid = "59">For our method, we compare two different training sets: one is trained on all 519K sentence pairs, the other only uses 186K reachable sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="208" ssid = "60">Although the perceptron system exploits 2.4K features, it fails to produce stable improvements over MERT.</S>
			<S sid ="209" ssid = "61">The reason may come from overfitting, since the training data for perceptron contains only 878 sentences.</S>
			<S sid ="210" ssid = "62">However, when use our method to learn the word context feature on the 519K data, we significantly improve the performance by 0.84 points on the entire test sets (ALL).</S>
			<S sid ="211" ssid = "63">The improvements range from 0.60 to 1.16 points on MT03 05.</S>
			<S sid ="212" ssid = "64">Because we use the full vocabulary, the num-.</S>

			<S sid ="214" ssid = "66">These results confirm the necessity of exploiting more features and learning the parameters on large data.</S>
			<S sid ="215" ssid = "67">Meanwhile, such results also demonstrate that we can benefits from the forest generated by our fast method instead of traditional CKY algorithm.</S>
			<S sid ="216" ssid = "68">Not surprisingly, the improvements are smaller when only use 186K reachable sentences.</S>

			<S sid ="228" ssid = "80">The plot confirms that our training algorithm scales linearly.</S>
			<S sid ="229" ssid = "81">If we use n-best lists which generated by CKY decoder as MERT, it takes about 3105 milliseconds/sentence for producing 100-best lists.</S>
			<S sid ="230" ssid = "82">Our method accelerates the speed about 97 times (even though we search twice to calculate the gradient).</S>
			<S sid ="231" ssid = "83">This shows the efficiency of our method.</S>
			<S sid ="232" ssid = "84">The procedure of training includes two steps.</S>
			<S sid ="233" ssid = "85">(1) Bi-parsing to initialize a reference derivation with max score.</S>
			<S sid ="234" ssid = "86">(2) Training procedure which generates a set of derivations to calculate the gradient and update parameters.</S>
			<S sid ="235" ssid = "87">Step (1) only runs once.</S>
			<S sid ="236" ssid = "88">The average time of processing a sentence for each step is about 9.5 milliseconds and 30.2 milliseconds respectively.</S>
			<S sid ="237" ssid = "89">For simplicity we do not compress the generated derivations into forests, therefore the size of resulting derivations is fairly small, which is about 265.8 for each sentence on average, where 6.1 of them are reference derivations.</S>
			<S sid ="238" ssid = "90">Furthermore, we use lexical- ize operator more often than generalize operator (the ration between them is 1.5 to 1).</S>
			<S sid ="239" ssid = "91">Lexicalize operator is used more frequently mainly dues to that the reference derivations are initialized with reusable (thus Chiang et al., 2009), gradient descent (Blunsom et al., 2008; Blunsom and Osborne, 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="240" ssid = "92">The complexity of n-best lists or packed forests generation hamper these algorithms to scale to a large amount of data.</S>
			<S sid ="241" ssid = "93">For efficiency, we only use neighboring derivations for training.</S>
			<S sid ="242" ssid = "94">Such motivation is same as con- trastive estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Poon et al., 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="243" ssid = "95">The difference lies in that the previous work actually care about their latent variables (pos tags, segmentation, dependency trees, etc), while we are only interested in their marginal distribution.</S>
			<S sid ="244" ssid = "96">Furthermore, we focus on how to fast generate translation forest for training.</S>
			<S sid ="245" ssid = "97">The local operators lexicalize/generalize are use for greedy decoding.</S>
			<S sid ="246" ssid = "98">The idea is related to “pegging” algorithm (Brown et al., 1993) and greedy decoding (Germann et al., 2001).</S>
			<S sid ="247" ssid = "99">Such types of local operators are also used in Gibbs sampler for synchronous grammar induction (Blunsom et al., 2009; Cohn and Blunsom, 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="248" ssid = "100">8 Conclusion and Future Work.</S>
			<S sid ="249" ssid = "101">We have presented a fast generation algorithm for translation forest which contains both reference derivations and neighboring non-reference derivations for large-scale SMT discriminative training.</S>
			<S sid ="250" ssid = "102">We have achieved significantly improvement of 0.84 BLEU by incorporate 13.9M feature trained on 519K data in 0.03 second per sentence.</S>
			<S sid ="251" ssid = "103">In this paper, we define the forest based on competing derivations which only differ in one rule.</S>
			<S sid ="252" ssid = "104">There may be better classes of forest that can produce a better performance.</S>
			<S sid ="253" ssid = "105">It’s interesting to modify the definition of forest, and use more local operators to increase the size of forest.</S>
			<S sid ="254" ssid = "106">Furthermore, since the generation of forests is quite general, it’s straight to apply our forest on other learning algorithms.</S>
			<S sid ="255" ssid = "107">Finally, we hope to exploit more features such as reordering features and syntactic features so as to further improve the performance.</S>
