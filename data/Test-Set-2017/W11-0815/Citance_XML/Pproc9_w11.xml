			<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">A word expression is semantically compositional if its meaning can be understood from the literal meaning of its components.</S>
			<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">Therefore, semanti­ cally compositional expressions involve e.g. &quot;small island&quot; or &apos;&apos;hot water&quot;; on the other hand, seman­ tically non-compositional expressions are e.g. &quot;red tape&quot; or &quot;kick the bucket&quot;.</S>
			<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">The notion of compositionality is closely related to idiomacy -the higher the compositionality the lower the idiomacy and vice versa (Sag et al., 2002; Baldwin and Kim, 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="9" ssid = "9">Non-compositional expressions are often referred to as Multiword Expressions (MWEs).</S>
			<S sid ="10" ssid = "10">Baldwin and Kim (2010) differentiate the following sub-types of Pavel Pecina Charles University in Prague Faculty of Mathematics and Physics Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics Prague, Czech Republic pecina@ufal.mff.cuni.cz compositionality: lexical, syntactic, semantic, prag­ matic, and statistical.</S>
			<S sid ="11" ssid = "11">This paper is concerned with semantic compositionality.</S>
			<S sid ="12" ssid = "12">Compositionality as a feature of word expressions is not discrete.</S>
			<S sid ="13" ssid = "13">Instead, expressions populate a con­ tinuum between two extremes: idioms and free word combinations (McCarthy et al., 2003; Bannard et al., 2003; Katz, 2006; Fazly, 2007; Baldwin and Kim, 2010; Biemann and Giesbrecht, 2011).</S>
			<S sid ="14" ssid = "14">Typical ex­ amples of expressions between the two extremes are &quot;zebra crossing&quot; or &quot;blind alley&quot;.</S>
			<S sid ="15" ssid = "15">Our research in compositionality is motivated by the hypothesis that a special treatment of se­ mantically non-compositional expressions can im­ prove results in various Natural Language Process­ ing (NPL) tasks, as shown for example by Acosta et al.</S>
			<S sid ="16" ssid = "16">(2011), who utilized MWEs in Information Re­ trieval (IR).</S>
			<S sid ="17" ssid = "17">Besides that, there are other NLP ap­ plications that can benefit from knowing the degree of compositionality of expressions such as machine translation (Carpuat and Diab, 2010), lexicography (Church and Hanks, 1990), word sense disambigua­ tion (Finlayson and Kulkarni, 2011), part-of-speech (POS) tagging and parsing (Seretan, 2008) as listed in Rarnisch (2012).</S>
			<S sid ="18" ssid = "18">The main goal of this paper is to present an anal­ ysis of previous approaches using WSMs for de­ termining the semantic compositionality of expres­ sions.</S>
			<S sid ="19" ssid = "19">The analysis can be found in Section 2.</S>
			<S sid ="20" ssid = "20">A special attention is paid to the evaluation of the pro­ posed models that is described in Section 3.</S>

			<S sid ="25" ssid = "1">Expressions Determined by WSMs Several recent works, including lin (1999), Schone and Jurafsky (2001), Baldwin et al.</S>

			<S sid ="27" ssid = "3">(2003), Katz (2006), Johannsen et al.</S>

			<S sid ="29" ssid = "5">(2011a), and KrCmar et al.</S>
			<S sid ="30" ssid = "6">(2012), show the ability of methods based on WSMs to capture the degree of semantic compositionality of word expressions.</S>
			<S sid ="31" ssid = "7">We analyse the proposed meth­ ods and discuss their differences.</S>
			<S sid ="32" ssid = "8">As further de­ scribed in detail and summarized in Table 1, the ap­ proaches differ in the type of WSMs, corpora, pre­ processing techniques, methods for determining the compositionality, datasets for evaluation, and meth­ ods of evaluation itself.</S>
			<S sid ="33" ssid = "9">Our understanding of WSM is in agreement with Sahlgren (2006): &quot;The word space model is a com­ putational model of word meaning that utilizes the distributional patterns of words collected over large text data to represent semantic similarity between words in terms of spatial proximity&quot;.</S>
			<S sid ="34" ssid = "10">For more information on WSMs, see e.g. Turney and Pan­ tel (2010), Jurgens and Stevens (2010), or Sahlgren (2006).</S>
			<S sid ="35" ssid = "11">WSMs and their parameters WSMs can be built by different algorithms including LSA (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), Hyperspace Analogue to Lan­ guage (HAL) (Lund and Burgess, 1996), Random Indexing (Rl) (Sahlgren, 2005), and Correlated Oc­ currence Analogue to Lexical Semantics (COALS) (Rohde et al., 2005).</S>
			<S sid ="36" ssid = "12">Every algorithm has its own specifics and can be configured in different ways.</S>
			<S sid ="37" ssid = "13">The configuration usually involves e.g. the choice of context size, weighting functions, or normaliz­ ing functions.</S>
			<S sid ="38" ssid = "14">While Schone and Jurafsky (2001), Baldwin et al.</S>
			<S sid ="39" ssid = "15">(2003), and Katz (2006) addopted LSA-based approaches, Johannsen et al.</S>
			<S sid ="40" ssid = "16">(2011) and Krcmar et al.</S>
			<S sid ="41" ssid = "17">(2012) employ COALS; the others use their own specific WSMs.</S>
			<S sid ="42" ssid = "18">Corpora and text preprocessing Using differ­ ent corpora and their preprocessing naturally leads to different WSMs.</S>
			<S sid ="43" ssid = "19">The preprocessing can differ e.g. in the choice of used word forms or in re­ moval/retaining of low-frequency words.</S>
			<S sid ="44" ssid = "20">For exam­ ple, while Lin (1999) employs a 125-million-word newspaper corpus, Schone and Jurafsky (2001) use a 6.7-million-word subset of the TREC databases, Baldwin et al.</S>
			<S sid ="45" ssid = "21">(2003) base their experiments on 90 million words from the British National Corpus (Burnard, 2000).</S>

			<S sid ="47" ssid = "23">(2012), Johannsen et al.</S>
			<S sid ="48" ssid = "24">(2011), and Reddy et al.</S>
			<S sid ="49" ssid = "25">(2011a) use the ukWaC corpus, consisting of 1.9 billion words from web texts (Baroni et al., 2009).</S>
			<S sid ="50" ssid = "26">As for preprocessing, Lin (1999) extracts triples with dependency relation­ ships, Baldwin et al.</S>
			<S sid ="51" ssid = "27">(2003), Reddy et al.</S>
			<S sid ="52" ssid = "28">(2011a), and Krcmar et al.</S>
			<S sid ="53" ssid = "29">(2012) concatenate word lemmas with their POS categories.</S>
			<S sid ="54" ssid = "30">Johannsen et al.</S>
			<S sid ="55" ssid = "31">(2011) use word lemmas and remove low-frequency words while Reddy et al.</S>
			<S sid ="56" ssid = "32">(2011a), for example, keep only frequent content words.</S>
			<S sid ="57" ssid = "33">Methods We have identified three basic methods for determining semantic compositionality: 1) The substitutability-based methods exploit the fact that replacing components of non­ compositional expressions by words which are similar leads to anti-collocations (Pearce, 2002).</S>
			<S sid ="58" ssid = "34">Then, frequency or mutual information of such expressions (anti-collocations) is compared with the frequency or mutual information of the original expressions.</S>
			<S sid ="59" ssid = "35">For example, consider expected occur­ rence counts of &apos;&apos;hot dog&quot; and its anti-collocations such as &quot;warm dog&quot; or &quot;hot terrier&apos;&apos;.</S>
			<S sid ="60" ssid = "36">2) The component-based methods, utilized for ex­ ample by Baldwin et al.</S>
			<S sid ="61" ssid = "37">(2003) or Johannsen et al.</S>
			<S sid ="62" ssid = "38">(2011), compare the distributional characteristics of expressions and their components.</S>
			<S sid ="63" ssid = "39">The context vec­ tors expected to be different from each other are e.g. the vector representing the expression &quot;hot dog&quot; and the vector representing the word &quot;dog&quot;.</S>
			<S sid ="64" ssid = "40">3) The compositionality-based methods compare two vectors of each analysed expression: the true co-occurrence vector of an expression and the vec­ tur obtained from vectors corresponding to the com­ ponents of the expression using a compositional­ ity function (Reddy et al., 2011a).</S>
			<S sid ="65" ssid = "41">The most com­ mon compositionality functions are vector addition or pointwise vector multiplication (Mitchell and La­ pata, 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="66" ssid = "42">For example, the vectors for &apos;&apos;hot dog&quot; and &quot;hot&quot;E!l&quot;dog&quot; are supposed to be different.</S>
			<S sid ="67" ssid = "43">Evaluation datasets There is still no consensus on how to evaluate models deterntining semantic compositionality.</S>

			<S sid ="79" ssid = "55">Secondly, the low­ coverage problem of dictionaries, which originates for example due to the facts that new MWEs still arise or are domain specific, is avoided.1 For exam­ ple, Lin (1999), Schone and Jurafsky (2001), Bald­ win et al.</S>

	<SECTION title="Evaluation Methods. " number = "3">
			<S sid ="81" ssid = "1">This section discusses evaluation methods includ­ ing average point difference (APD), Spearman and Kendall correlations, and precision of classifica­ tion (PoC) suggested by Biemann and Giesbrecht (2011); Precision/nBest, RecalllnBest and Preci­ sion/Recall curves proposed by Evert (2005); and Average Precision used by Pecina (2009).</S>
			<S sid ="82" ssid = "2">Our eval­ uation is based on the English part of the manu­ ally annotated datasets DISCO 2011 (Biemann and Giesbrecht, 2011), further referred to as DISCO-En­ Gold.</S>
			<S sid ="83" ssid = "3">Disco-En-Gold consists of 349 expressions di­ vided into training (TrainD), validation (ValD), and test data (TestD) manually assigned scores from 0 to 100, indicating the level of compositionality (the lower the score the lower the compositionality and vice versa).</S>
			<S sid ="84" ssid = "4">The expressions are of the following types: adjective-noun (AN), verb-object (YO), and subject-verb (SV).</S>
			<S sid ="85" ssid = "5">Based on the numerical scores, the expressions are also classified into three disjoint classes (coarse scores): low, medium, and high com­ positional.2 A sample of the Disco-En-Gold data is presented in Table 2.</S>
			<S sid ="86" ssid = "6">Comparison of evaluation methods The purpose of the DISCO workshop was to find the best meth­ ods for determining semantic compositionality.</S>

			<S sid ="92" ssid = "12">PoC is defined as the ratio of correct coarse predictions to the number of all the predictions.</S>
			<S sid ="93" ssid = "13">Following KrCmaf et a!.</S>
			<S sid ="94" ssid = "14">(2012), we argue that for the purpose of comparison of the methods, the values assigned to a set of expressions by a certain model are not as important as is the ranking of the expressions (which is not sensitive to the original distribution of compositionality values).</S>
			<S sid ="95" ssid = "15">Similarly as Evert (2005), Pecina (2009), and KrCmar et a!.</S>
			<S sid ="96" ssid = "16">(2012) we adopt evaluation based on ranking (al­ though the measures such as PoC or APD might pro­ vide useful information too).</S>
			<S sid ="97" ssid = "17">Evaluation based on ranking can be realized by measuring ranked correlations (Spearman and Kendall) or Precision/Recall scores and curves com­ monly used e.g. in IR (Manning et a!., 2008).</S>
			<S sid ="98" ssid = "18">In IR, Precision is defined as the ratio of found rele­ vant documents to all the retrieved documents with regards to a user&apos;s query.</S>
			<S sid ="99" ssid = "19">Recall is defined as the ra­ tio of found relevant documents to all the relevant documents in a test set to the user&apos;s query.</S>
			<S sid ="100" ssid = "20">The Precision/Recall curve is a curve depicting the de­ pendency of Precision upon Recall.</S>
			<S sid ="101" ssid = "21">Analogously, the scheme can be used for evaluation of the meth­ ods finding semantically non-compositional expres­ sions.</S>
			<S sid ="102" ssid = "22">However, estimation of Recall is not possible without knowledge of the correct class3 for every ex­ pression in a corpus.</S>
			<S sid ="103" ssid = "23">To bypass this, Evert (2005) calcnlates Recall with respect to the set of annotated data divided into non-compositional and composi­ tional classes.</S>
			<S sid ="104" ssid = "24">The Precision/nBest, Recall!nBest, and Precision/Recall curves for the LSA experiment 3A semantically non-compositional expression or a seman­ tically compositional expressions described in the following section are depicted in Figures 1 and 2.</S>
			<S sid ="105" ssid = "25">Evert&apos;s (2005) curves allow us to visually com­ pare the results of the methods in more detail.</S>
			<S sid ="106" ssid = "26">To facilitate comparison of several methods, we also suggest using average precision (AP) adopted from Pecina (2009), which reduces information provided by a single Precision/Recall curve to one value.</S>

	<SECTION title="LSA experiment. " number = "4">
			<S sid ="108" ssid = "1">LSA is WSM based on the Singular Value De­ composition (SVD) factorization (Deerwester et a!., 1990) applied to the co-occurrence matrix.</S>
			<S sid ="109" ssid = "2">In the matrix, the numbers of word occurrences in speci­ fied contexts4 are stored.</S>
			<S sid ="110" ssid = "3">The row vectors of the ma­ trix capture the word meanings.5 The idea of using SVD is to project vectors corresponding to the words into a lower-dimensional space and thus bring the vectors of words with similar meaning near to each other.</S>
			<S sid ="111" ssid = "4">We built LSA WSM and applied the component­ based method to Disco-En-Gold.</S>
			<S sid ="112" ssid = "5">We used our own modification of the LSA algorithm originally implemented in the S-Space package (Jurgens and Stevens, 2010).</S>
			<S sid ="113" ssid = "6">The modification lies in treating ex­ pressions and handling stopwords.</S>
			<S sid ="114" ssid = "7">Specifically, we added vectors for the examined expressions to WSM in such a way that the original vectors for words were preserved.</S>
			<S sid ="115" ssid = "8">This differentiates our approach e.g. from Baldwin et a!.</S>
			<S sid ="116" ssid = "9">(2003) or Johannsen et a!.</S>
			<S sid ="117" ssid = "10">(2011) who label the expressions ahead of time and build WSMs treating them as single words.</S>
			<S sid ="118" ssid = "11">Treat­ ing the expressions as the single words affects the WSM vectors of their constituents.</S>
			<S sid ="119" ssid = "12">As an example, consider the replacement of occurrences of &quot;short distance&quot; by e.g. the EXP#l23 label.</S>
			<S sid ="120" ssid = "13">This affects the WSM vectors of &quot;short&quot; and &quot;distance&quot; since the numbers of their occurrences and the numbers of contexts they occur in drops.</S>
			<S sid ="121" ssid = "14">Consequently, this also affects the methods for determining the compo­ sitionality which are based upon using the vectors of 4The commonly used contexts for words are documents or the preceding and following words in a specified window.</S>
			<S sid ="122" ssid = "15">5WSMs exploit Harris&apos; distributional hypothesis (Hatris, 1954), which states that semantically similar words tend to ap­ pear in similar contexts.</S>
			<S sid ="123" ssid = "16">expressions&apos; constituents.</S>
			<S sid ="124" ssid = "17">As for treating stopwords, we mapped the trigram expressions containing the determiners &quot;the&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, or &quot;an&quot; as the middle word to the corresponding hi­ gram expressions without the determiners.</S>
			<S sid ="125" ssid = "18">The intu­ ition is to extract more precise co-occurrence vectors for the YO expressions often containing some inter­ vening determiner.</S>
			<S sid ="126" ssid = "19">As an example, compare the oc­ currences of &quot;reinvent wheel&quot; and &quot;reinvent (deter­ miner) wheel&quot; in the ukWaC corpus which are 27 and 623, respectively, or the occurrences of &quot;cross bridge&quot; and &quot;cross (determiner) bridge&quot; being 50 and 1050, respectively.6 We built LSA WSM from the whole ukWaC POS-tagged corpus for all the word lemmas con­ catenated with their POS tags excluding stopwords.</S>
			<S sid ="127" ssid = "20">We treated the following strings as stopwords: the lemmas with frequency below 50 (omitting low­ frequency words), the strings containing two adja­ cent non-letter characters (omitting strings such as web addresses and sequences of e.g. star symbols), and lemmas with a different POS tag from noun, proper noun, adjective, verb, and adverb (omitting closed-class words).</S>
			<S sid ="128" ssid = "21">As contexts, the entire docu­ ments were used.</S>
			<S sid ="129" ssid = "22">The co-occurrence matrix for words was normal­ ized by applying the log-entropy transformation and reduced to 300 dimensions.</S>
			<S sid ="130" ssid = "23">Using these settings, Landauer and Dumais (1997) obtained the best re­ sults.</S>
			<S sid ="131" ssid = "24">Finally, the co-occurrence vectors of expres­ sions were expressed in the lower-dimensional space of words in a manner analogous to how a user&apos;s query is being expressed in lower-dimensional space of documents in IR (Berry eta!., 1995).</S>
			<S sid ="132" ssid = "25">The Disco­ En-Gold expressions were sorted in ascending order by the average cosine similarity between the vec­ tors corresponding to the expressions and the vectors corresponding to their components.</S>

			<S sid ="139" ssid = "32">For the AP evalu­ ation, the expressions with numerical values less or equal to 50 were classified as non-compositional7 , giving us the ratio of non-compositional expressions in TrainVa!D and TestD equal to 0.26 and 0.20, re­ spectively.</S>

			<S sid ="163" ssid = "1">We analysed the previous works applying WSMs for determining the semantic compositionality of ex­ pressions.</S>
			<S sid ="164" ssid = "2">We discussed and summarized the major­ ity of techniques presented in the papers.</S>
			<S sid ="165" ssid = "3">Our anal­ ysis reveals a large diversity of approaches which leads to incomparable results (Table 1).</S>
			<S sid ="166" ssid = "4">Since it has been shown that WSMs can serve as good predic­ tors of semantic compositionality, we aim to create a comparative study of the approaches.</S>
			<S sid ="167" ssid = "5">Our analysis implies to evaluate the proposed ap­ proaches using human annotated data and evalua­ tion techniques based on ranking.</S>
			<S sid ="168" ssid = "6">Namely, we sug­ gest using Spearman and Kendall correlations, Pre­ cision!nBest, RecalllnBest, Precision/Recall curves, andAP.</S>
			<S sid ="169" ssid = "7">Using the suggested evaluation techniques, we present the results of our first experiments exploit­ ing LSA (Figures 1, 2 and Table 3).</S>
			<S sid ="170" ssid = "8">The results of the LSA-based model, compared with random base­ lines, PMI-based model, and all the WSM-based and statistical-based models proposed by the participants of the DISCO task, are very promising.</S>
