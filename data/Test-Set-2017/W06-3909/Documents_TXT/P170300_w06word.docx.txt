Abstract

Linguistic relations in oral conversations present how opin- 
ions are constructed and developed in a restricted time. The 
relations bond ideas, arguments, thoughts, and feelings, re- 
shape them during a speech,  and finally build knowledge 
out of all information provided in the conversation. Speak- 
ers share a common  interest  to discuss. It is expected that 
each speakers reply includes duplicated forms of words from 
previous speakers. However, linguistic adaptation is observed 
and evolves in a more complex  path than just transferring 
slightly modified  versions of common concepts. A conver- 
sation aiming  a benefit at the end shows an emergent coop- 
eration inducing the adaptation. Not only cooperation, but 
also competition drives the adaptation or an opposite scenario 
and one can capture the dynamic process by tracking how the 
concepts are linguistically linked. To uncover salient complex 
dynamic events in verbal communications, we attempt to dis- 
cover self-organized linguistic relations hidden in a conver- 
sation with explicitly stated winners and losers. We examine 
open access data of the United States Supreme Court. Our un- 
derstanding is crucial in big data research to guide how transi- 
tion states in opinion mining and decision-making should be 
modeled and how this required knowledge to guide the model 
should be pinpointed, by filtering large amount of data.

Introduction

Traditionally, in computational linguistics, it is essential to 
integrate models and algorithms with fundamental laws of 
language. Widely  applied hierarchical dependency trees and 
parsing in natural language processing (NLP) follow exist- 
ing grammatical relations. Nowadays, while algorithms and 
models reach higher levels and available data becomes big- 
ger, not enough linguistic  laws are uncovered and can have 
a chance to meet with developed techniques. Language pro- 
cessing in data science mainly considers  evaluated  data as 
single source in terms of language. There are approaches 
such as cross-media  topic analysis, retrieving  information 
referring various data platforms including  websites, blogs, 
and mobile phones, and multimodal  analysis (Poria et al.
2016; Poria et al. 2017a; Poria et al. 2017b), combining 
text data with images, videos, and audio, however, they only 
gather all available channels and do not address the richness 
of language.
  

On the other hand, language itself has many dimensions, 
language of a text written by a single author is different than 
language used in a dialogue  or that of a group speech, e.g., 
trialogue discussions. Therefore, it is emergent that current 
conventional NLP should meet with the revolutionary  phi- 
losophy of linguistics  (Chomsky  1975) and establish new 
hidden laws applicable in data science: the human mind eas- 
ily knows and applies by birth, but hardly formulates to un- 
derstand the underlying structure.
  One of the remarkable perspectives to dig into natural lin- 
guistic laws is provided by social and behavior  sciences, 
adaptation in language during communication  as a result 
of changes in opinions  and decisions. Opinions  and deci- 
sions are personal in individual level, however,  they are 
flexible while  facing public opinions and decisions. Lin- 
guistic adaptation is twofold. In one part, collective  voice 
unifies opinions and decisions in a complex  process, ideas 
are biased, and consequently  people start acting similarly, 
talking similarly, and so  writing similarly. Twitter con- 
versations (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil,  Gamon, and Dumais
2011; Purohit et al. 2013) and popular memes (Myers and 
Leskovec 2012; Coscia 2013) prove this similarity in social 
media.
  In the other part, when people have a well-defined  goal at 
the end, they tend to reshape their arguments. In the pres- 
ence of distinct winning  and losing sides and social hierar- 
chy, people at lower status show both cooperation through 
that at the higher status and competition  among each other. 
Therefore,  a verbal  discussion in such explicitly opposing 
groups host linguistic adaptation, investigated in social ex- 
change theory (Willer 1999; Thye, Willer, and Markovsky
2006). While information and emotions are the fundamental 
elements of human knowledge, commonsense knowledge is 
the fundamental element for gluing society (Cambria et al.
2009; Cambria et al. 2016). Commonsense is implicit se- 
mantic and affective information  humans continuously tap 
on for decision-making,  communication,  and reasoning in 
general (Cambria and Hussain 2015; Rajagopal et al. 2013; 
Poria et al. 2013; Tran, Cambria, and Hussain 2016). Effec- 
tive speeches and public  talks use commonsense efficiently 
to drive opinions and change decisions in large scales (Drath 
and Palus 1994). The resultant unified collective  motion is
extremely interesting in social groups (Borge-Holthoefer  et
al. 2011; Gonzalez-Bailon et al. 2011).


  Opinions  and decisions are personal in individual level. 
However,  as observed, they are quite flexible facing with a 
collective decision. Complex knowledge extraction process 
in micro state suddenly becomes less valuable and group de- 
cision gains (Conover et al. 2011). We can argue that our 
opinions are biased when our decisions mostly rely on our 
previous knowledge,  e.g., commonsense, and so richness of 
opinions kept in each individual is relatively unimportant. 
We can further argue that commonsense drives an adaptation 
in extracting knowledge. To measure commonsense  for a 
particular situation is hard, however, adaptations can be eas- 
ily captured in Twitter conversations (Danescu-Niculescu- 
Mizil, Gamon, and Dumais 2011; Purohit et al. 2013), in 
memes (Myers and Leskovec 2012; Coscia 2013), and face- 
to-face discussions (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. 2012).
  In this paper, our main concerns are firstly to construct 
discussion groups including agents having different  social 
powers and serving opposite aims. Secondly, we investigate 
how we can track the progress of opinions together with 
their influences on decisions in oral conversations. We claim 
that linguistic  relations (Poria et al. 2015) preserve all rich 
phenomena, shortly discussed above,  including collective 
voice, reshaping arguments, and so adaptation. To analyze 
adaptation induced by both cooperation and competition, we 
consider court conversations: they are held in clearly stated 
winner and loser groups with distinct hierarchy in decision- 
making due to the presence of Justices and lawyers.

  To this end, we evaluate  the open access  data of the 
United  States Supreme Court (Hawes, Lin, and Resnik 2009; 
Hawes 2009; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. 2012), prepare 
conversation groups with different adaptation levels, imple- 
ment a suitable algorithm  to extract linguistic relations in 
these group conversations, and finally provide a comparison 
between the groups and the discovered linguistic  relations.
  The rest of the paper is organized  as follows: the first sec- 
tion presents the dataset we consider and designed conver- 
sation groups out of the data; the second section describes 
our algorithm in detail; the following section explains how 
we implement pointwise mutual information for the conver- 
sation groups and then link with linguistic relations; finally, 
we provide experimental results and conclude the paper.

Supreme Court Data

We  borrow the textual data of the conversations  in the 
United  States Supreme Court pre-processed by (Hawes, Lin, 
and Resnik 2009; Hawes 2009) and enriched by (Danescu- 
Niculescu-Mizil et al. 2012) including the final votes of 
Justices. Both the original data and the most updated ver- 
sion used here are publicly available (Danescu-Niculescu- 
Mizil et al. 2012). The data gathers oral speeches before the 
Supreme Court and hosts 50,389 conversational exchanges 
among Justices and lawyers.
  Distinct hierarchy  between  Justices (high power) and 
lawyers (low power) impose lawyers to tune their arguments 
under the perspective and understandings of Justices, and as 
a result, speech adaptation and linguistic coordination leaves 
their traces in a sudden occurrence  of sharing the same ad- 
verbs, conjunctions,  and pronouns. Tracking initial utter- 
ances, the sides present a unique and personal speaking, but
after a while in the communication, word selections, their 
forms, and frequencies mirror each other’s  language pref- 
erence. The linguistic coordination is systematically quanti- 
fied by (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. 2012) and the argu- 
ments follow the principles of exchange theory examining 
behavior dynamics in low and high power groups (Willer
1999; Thye, Willer, and Markovsky  2006): Lawyers tend 
to cooperate more to Justices than conversely and demon- 
strate strong linguistic coordination in their speech. More- 
over, lawyers  show even more cooperation to unfavorable 
Justices than favorable ones.
  Here, we enrich the comparison including the identity of 
winners and losers in lawsuits. The data provides whether 
the petitioner or the respondent is the winner at the end of 
each lawsuit. In addition, the speaker of each utterance is la- 
beled as their position, e.g., Justice or lawyer. Furthermore, 
Justice’s votes and the side of lawyers are tagged with the 
utterances. Table 1 identifies all roles carried by Justices and 
lawyers. For Justices, both the vote (middle)  and whom to 
speak (last) are given. Lawyers  are allowed  to speak only 
when Justices address their side.

ID 	Roles of Justices (J ) and Lawyers (l)
1	J - Vote Petitioner - Speak to Petitioner’s l
2	J - Vote Petitioner - Speak to Respondent’s l
3	J - Vote Respondent - Speak to Petitioner’s l
4	J - Vote Respondent - Speak to Respondent’s l
5	l - Petitioner Side
6	l - Respondent Side

Table 1: The segregation schema of the roles in conversa- 
tions: Support  sides of Justices and sides of lawyers. 1-6 
summarize all potential roles present in the data. In 1-4, who 
supported by the Justice is given in the middle. Furthermore, 
the last indicates the side of lawyer  the Justice speaks to.

  Referring  exchange theory (Willer 1999; Thye, Willer, 
and  Markovsky  2006)  and  the  measured coordina- 
tion (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. 2012), one can order 
the relative power of each Justice and lawyer pair
P (Ju , l) > P (Js , l), 	(1)
where J and l represent Justices and lawyers,  respectively 
(note that for comparing individually following the social 
exchange theory, P (J ) > P (l) for both supportive and un- 
supported Justices). The subscript u indicates that Justice 
doesn’t support the side of lawyer and the supportive ver- 
sion is described by s. For instance, in Table 1, in the com- 
munications of 1 and 5; 4 and 6, Justices show supports and 
play as Js , whereas that of 3 and 5; 2 and 6, lawyers are 
unsupported by Ju . The scenarios and pairs guide to con- 
struct groups with different cooperation level induced by P 
as illustrated in Table 2.
  We further add another dimension in the relative power: 
Winners  and Losers, haven’t  been investigated in the pre- 
vious study (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil  et al. 2012). To this 
end, Eq. 1 is reformulated
P (Ju , l)win	>   P (Js , l)win ,	(2)
P (Ju , l)lose	>  P (Js , l)lose .	(3)


Group ID 	Cooperation	Pool of J and l
I.i 	supportive, P (Js , l)	1 and 5
I.ii 	unsupported, P (Ju , l)	3 and 5
II.i 	unsupported, P (Ju , l)	2 and 6
II.ii 	supportive, P (Js , l)	4 and 6

Table 2: Grouping communications with respect to level 
of cooperation,  based on the relative power of the partners 
in the conversations. 1-6 and the power pairs P (Js , l) and 
P (Ju , l) as defined previously.


  Here, win and lose subscripts highlight  that the concerned 
Justice and lawyer pairs are the partners in a won or lost 
lawsuit. As an illustration, P (Js , l)win occurs in the group 
I.i when petitioners are the winner and also in II.ii while re- 
spondents are the winners of the lawsuits. On the other hand, 
P (Js , l)lose  is the Justices-lawyers of I.i in respondent won 
lawsuits  as well as of II.ii in petitioner won lawsuits. The 
situations  are generated for the unsupported Justice-lawyer 
groups and all are listed in Table 3.

  κ     Cooperation                            Gathering Group ID 
A	supportive, win: P (Js , l)win          I.i of Pe + II.ii of Re 
B 	supportive, lose: P (Js , l)lose           I.i of Re + II.ii of Pe 
C	unsupported, win: P (Ju , l)win      I.ii of Pe + II.i of Re 
D 	unsupported, lose: P (Ju , l)lose      I.ii of Re + II.i of Pe

Table 3: Designed conversation groups κ based on different 
expectations for the level of linguistic coordination, induced 
by distinct P . The groups κ are presented in A, B, C , and 
D, whether they preserve supportive  or unsupported con- 
versations  as well as a winner  or loser status stated by the 
Supreme Court. Pe and Re represent the particular  lawsuits 
where Petitioner and Respondent as the winner, respectively. 
Gathered conversations of the cases I.i, I.ii, II.i, and II.ii and 
the relative powers P are as introduced  earlier.

  Calculating  utterances in κ, we have 21,105 for A, 15,116 
for B, 15,489 for C , and 24,461 for D, gathered by differ- 
ent combinations of 195 lawsuits. The large number of each 
pool convinces that we have enough examples to perform 
statistics and our measurement won’t be biased by the size 
effect. On the other hand, noting the total number of 50,389 
utterances, almost the half of the data presents P (Ju , l)lose 
type social relations, e.g., case D. Eqs. (2) and (3) do not 
include the comparison of {P (Ju , l)win ; P (Js , l)lose } and
{P (Ju , l)lose ; P (Js , l)win } on purpose since it is unknown 
whether P (Ju , l) > P (Js , l) is still valid in the presence 
of win and lose, bringing interesting perspective while cou- 
pling the power hypothesis with the cooperation and not 
considered in social exchange theory. We aim to understand 
this full picture by correlating determined linguistic relations 
with the separated relative  power groups.

Linguistic Relation Extraction
The Supreme Court hosts lawsuits of rich subjects. To design 
specific linguistic relations in each distinct lawsuit is chal- 
lenging and not required. Our aim is to suggest relations suit-
able for any discussion concept. To generalize the task, we 
first determine noun phrases in the data following the def- 
inition in (Pennacchiotti  and Pantel 2006). The phrases are 
combinations of adjectives and nouns. The technical  steps 
include standard part-of-speech tagging including  grammar 
based chunk parser. We then restrict our attention to address 
the relations linking only determined noun phrases within 
one sentence. The data shows utterances of grammatically 
correct and well-organized  sentences. To this end, we ap- 
ply rule-based relation extraction. While Fig. 1 shows each 
step of the developed algorithm, steps (A-C) indicate the dis- 
cussed concept recognition of noun phrases.

  The rule-based schema starts with first restricting linguis- 
tic relations and then constructing static surface patterns 
(regular expressions) for them. The assigned patterns run as 
an iterative process searching the exact match of the real pat- 
terns between any concept pair, which is any noun phrase 
pair here. Within a sentence,  multiple relations can be ad- 
dressed based on the comparison in the iteration, to cap- 
ture both different relations or the same relation  but with 
the different patterns. To balance the relations without  over- 
weighting extreme cases, we first apply classical  IsA (Hearst
1992) and PartOf (Girju, Badulescu, and Moldovan  2003) 
relations. The patterns of the relations follow both lexico- 
syntactic formalisms  (Klaussner and Zhekova 2011) and 
manual investigations of the data.
  We then recommend further relations as UsedBy, Used- 
For, UsedIn,  UsedOver, and UsedWith to cover the rest 
of the data. The Used relations do not accumulate  for 
certain lawsuits and nicely distribute over entire data, which 
provides us reliable analysis. Fig. 1(D and E) highlight the 
iteration process to detect all potential relations. To illustrate 
the outcome of our algorithm, we provide examples  for 
each relation. They are given with the detected noun phrases 
in Table 4. The identity of the sentences, a-g, are to guide 
the following concerned examples, where the linked noun 
phrases are highlighted in bold:
(a) That was  so  because  her claim is that J. Howard 
intended to give her a catchall trust.
(b) And when you look at the core value of the two clauses, 
they do not clash.
(c) And what I’m  trying to do here for  the Court is 
to  draw  upon your  own authority, the  word  you’ve 
spoken, as    opposed to   the  test   proposed by   the 
Criminal Justice Foundation and by the United States. 
(d) One, the manufacturing  process allows there to be a 
safe use for one of the components in marijuana.
(e) The phrase Justice Harlan  used in the Davis case.
(f) For 124 years, as state power  over alcohol has ebbed 
and flowed.
(g) The haulers  are required today to comply with the
program.
  The validation of the discovered linguistic relations and 
their suggested patterns are systematically  satisfied by the 
following protocol. From each conversation group κ in Ta- 
ble 3, 1000 utterances are randomly  selected. Utterances 
present  averages  sentences  of 2-4, the minimum is for 
the group C , P (Ju , l)win , and the maximum for group D, 
P (Ju , l)lose .

  Then, manual  annotations are provided for each pool, 
which works as the ground truth, and the patterns are re- 
adjusted if necessary based on the performance,  as shown


Here, f (R, κ) represents the frequency of occurrence for
certain R in particular κ and N is the total number of all R 
in all κ. So, while the numerator describes the probabilistic 
occurrence of R in κ, the denominator provides individual 
probability of R and that of κ in the pool. We expect high 
M I (R, κ) while R appears in a specific κ and that is an in- 
dicator of its rare presence in the other conversation groups. 
Unlike the previous study (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et
al. 2012), entirely tracking back and forth utterances and 
proving the adaptation, e.g., linguistic coordination, by iden- 
tifying the frequency of selected keywords, we directly  uti- 
lize their overall conclusion and claim that linguistic rela- 
tions already preserve the adaptation and any other complex 
collective linguistic process induced  by both cooperation 
and competition  in different power groups. We expect that 
the variation in M I (R, κ) of gathered utterances of each rel- 
ative power group, independent of the utterance order, sug- 
gests which relations can distinguish  the difference in the 
groups and the magnitude of M I (R, κ) of that difference 
highlights which relative power groups drastically influence 
the applied language. We will analyze M I (R, κ) following 
this discussed understanding in coming Section.

Results
We perform M I (R, κ) for each group κ separated by dif- 
ferent coordination level and linguistic  dynamics, expected 
due to the distinct relative powers as introduced in Table 3,


and each relation  R described in Section Linguistic Rela- 
tion Extraction.  The results are presented in Fig. 2 and sug- 
gests rich behavior. First, M I for the relations IsA, PartOf, 
and UsedBy is almost indistinguishable overall κ. We un- 
derstand that these relations  cannot uncover  the linguistic 
variations in different power groups. This is an obvious out- 
come of NLP and examining  sentences by lexico-syntactic 
patterns: Any sentence can consider them with no complex 
linguistic process such as coordination  and competition.  On 
the other hand, we observe quite remarkable separation start- 
ing with UsedFor. Successfully, the results of UsedIn, Use- 
dOver, and UsedWith show that their appearances in κ are 
not arbitrary.




A


states impose observable deviations and none group resem- 
bles each other, oppositely,  each presents very unique behav- 
ior. In a simplified picture, M I (R, κ) for C always indicates 
significantly  positive values. This proves that the utterances 
in C consider all type of relations, can be the reason behind 
the success of the “win” state in spite of the presence of un- 
supported Justices.

Conclusion
We investigated the linguistic dynamics in terms of a re- 
stricted set  of  linguistic relations in  oral conversations 
while the actors have  different powers such as Justices 
(high power) and lawyers (low power) in the United States 
Supreme Court. Initially, defined cooperation of lawyers to 
Justices and the resultant linguistic coordination are only 
based  on the relative power. This is a microscopic   pic- 
ture underestimating the dynamics of emergent competition

κ: M I (R, κ). The overall values indicate that, unlike IsA, 
PartOf, and UsedBy relations, the occurrences of UsedFor, 
UsedIn, UsedOver, and UsedWith are driven by the rela- 
tive power and the resultant linguistic  coordination and fur- 
ther complex process. The marker representations  are as fol- 
lows: Circles (blue) for A, squares (red) for B, left triangles 
(green) for C , and right triangles (yellow) for D.


  Evaluating the results in more detail, let us remind  Ta- 
ble 3. A  is expected  to have  the least relative  power, 
P (Js , l)win , and consequently, no significant variation is ob- 
served. However,  the situations are much more challenging 
for B, C , and D: They face with many conceptual chal- 
lenges while defending their sides and competing  with the 
opposite arguments, C and D, and to experiment different 
communications in a losing  state, B and D. Each difficulty 
is a potential  origin of the competition,  some can build suf- 
ficient cooperation  and make the lawyer winner, C , some 
cannot help to overcome the situation,  keep the coordina- 
tion limited, and so we experience lost lawsuits, B and D. 
To remind, B  for P (Js , l)lose , C for P (Ju , l)win , and D 
for P (Ju , l)lose . If we just call social exchange theory, for 
any measurable linguistic quantity, we would need to have 
A ≡ B and C ≡ D. However, we show that the win and lose


factors such as win-lose  situations. Furthermore,  we experi- 
ence that the rule-based relation extraction is well-applicable 
for speech data, in this grammatically correct form with mi- 
nor noise,  because of the presence of the linguistic adap- 
tation, providing a better  performance  than its usage for 
other type of textual  data such as internet  data. Furthermore, 
M I (R, κ) brings another perspective to uncover complex 
linguistic  dynamics, including cooperation and competition, 
and discover the correlations between the linguistic relations 
and the relative powers. We establish the preliminary  set-up 
to examine the linguistic  dynamics of trialogue discussions 
hosting in social groups with distinct hierarchy.
  Our main conclusion is that win and lose states impose 
further complexity  and change the conventional application 
of social exchange theory in language and communication. 
In our future study, we attempt to analyze back and forth 
utterances in detail regarding semantics bonding by the lin- 
guistic relations by applying advanced tools.
